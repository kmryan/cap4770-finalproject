Rotaviral infections are the leading causes of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide. 70 In the United States rotaviruses cause an estimated 3.9 million infections, with 2.7 million cases of gastroenteritis among children younger than 5 years of age. This results in approximately 500,000 outpatient and emergency visits and 49,000 hospitalizations. 71 The economic effect of rotavirus infections in health care is estimated at $264 million, with overall costs of approximately $1 billion. 71 Outbreaks of rotaviral infection are common in infants and young children in institutional settings such as hospitals, 72 daycare centers, 73, 74 and schools, 75 and hands of caregivers are believed to play an important role in virus spread. 10 Although asymptomatic infections are common, subjects with clinical cases excrete relatively large amounts of infectious virus in their feces, contributing to the ease of virus spread.
