From the identification of the novel coronavirus to implementation of routine laboratory testing around the world to the development of potential vaccines, laboratories have played a critical role in the efforts to curtail this pandemic. In this brief report, we review our own effort at a mid-sized, rural, academic medical center to implement a molecular test for the virus; and, we share insights and lessons learned from that process which might be helpful in similar situations in the future.",

An alarm was triggered for us when an initial attempt by the CDC to provide testing materials to state laboratories resulted in withdrawal of test kits due to contamination issues of reagents for one target region (N3) which was later removed, with resultant delays in developing early national testing capabilities.

In addition, the hurdles to developing and/or validating a laboratory developed test (LDT) for SARS-CoV2 became much greater when a Public Health Emergency was declared by the secretary of Health and Human Services on January 31 st 2020 (pursuant to Section 564(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7360bbb-3)) and the CDC assay was subsequently granted emergency use authorization on February 4th by the FDA.

While other control material such as synthetic controls and plasmids became available, the FDA maintained the need to use purified viral RNA and identified a vendor which could supply it. Initially laboratories were required to spike RNA transcripts into previously extracted nucleic acid from negative samples for the CDC assay to determine the limit of detection but this had its own challenges of not representing extraction of true clinical samples and issues with degradation were identified. We were then able, according to the FDA, spike purified viral RNA into crude patient specimens before performing the RNA extraction and RT-PCR portions of the procedure.",

As laboratories began to place orders for the RNA control, another bottleneck in the development and validation of laboratory testing became evident, as the supplier could not distribute this required material at a sufficient pace. At our institution, test development was delayed by more than two weeks because of the lack of access to this control material. Although we had several synthetic and plasmid controls sitting in our freezer, we were not allowed to use them for the \"spike-in\" experiments. Moreover, during multiple attempts to order the FDA-mandated RNA control, we were asked to complete numerous forms and applications that required signatures from institutional administrators who were already in the midst of dealing with the broader, evolving hospital virus crisis, creating an additional stress point. After significant feedback from clinical laboratories, the FDA indicated that the use of some synthetic control materials (in vitro RNA transcripts) could be used for the \"spike-in\" experiments one week after we had finally obtained the recommended RNA material. We chose to implement a verification strategy that would align with both emerging EUA guidance from the FDA and our standard requirements as a clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory operating under our usual regulatory framework of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification and accreditation through the College of American Pathologists (CAP). Our plan included the production of enough contrived clinical specimens and control material to proceed with validation or verification of the multiple (laboratory-developed and CDC EUA) tests that we were evaluating.",

In essence we created a \"validation set\" of extracted samples. The set included four known positive and four known negative patient samples that we obtained from the New Hampshire Public Health Laboratory (the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of Drs. Christine Bean and Fengxiang Gao), several presumed negative samples that had previously been tested for other bacterial/viral infections, and several positive contrived specimens (spiked with viral RNA or known positive patient specimens). In addition, we prepared standard operating procedures for the different extraction methods and RT-PCR assays as well as training documentation and worksheets. While these steps were in excess of what the FDA required, we wanted to be confident about the validity of each assay. These \"verification\" studies, while addressing typical performance characterisitcs of a test, were minimal compared to what a validation study would entail for a qualitative molecular test in our laboratory.",

We also implemented additional precautions for waste disposal (use of a double bagging technique and trash removal by molecular staff to minimize foot traffic in the laboratory) and modifications to hand washing and hand sanitizing practices (required hand washing between glove changes and increased frequency of glove changes).

One \"unknown\" -that we now know only too well and that is thwarting larger scale implementation of testing at our medical center -is the nation-wide shortage of collection swabs and transport media. While laboratories have the ability to use alternative transport media including saline, there is little we can do without collection devices. As each swab type used in clinical laboratory testing was eventually approved for use in assays, national supplies became exhausted. Viral transport media, historically a transport media used for molecular detection of viruses, was also becoming depleted across the country. Fear and chaos resulted from not knowing all the clinical challenges this virus would present, how many people would be infected and become symptomatic, the degree of severity of those symptoms and how many people could potentially die. As outlined above, we and other laboratory scientists quickly marshalled teams to develop and implement tests for the virus that hopefully will help shed light on these questions and prevent wide-scale panic and deaths.",

Molecular-based testing with a variety of real time PCR platforms should be granted rapid EUA status for use of standardized primer/probe sequences in conjunction with multiple specimen types and extraction methods. Federal agencies should be better prepared to distribute control materials as well as test reagents to laboratories operating outside of the State Health Laboratory network.
