            "text": "The Developing Countries' Vaccine Manufacturers Network, joined by global health organizations, held its 20th meeting celebrating two decades of vaccine innovations for global public good. Health leaders from industry, academia and global health organizations reviewed efforts to accelerate innovation, improve access to vaccines, overcome inequalities and strengthen technological and public-health management capabilities. Discussion topics included World Health Organization's immunization strategy, Pan American Health Organization's system-strengthening efforts, Gavi's evaluation of vaccine coverage in middle income countries and developments on public-market intelligence. Health market trends, delivery gaps, integration of system-wide needs, costs and benefits, and implications for stakeholder decisionmaking were areas of focus. Novel thinking was discussed on integration of policy, financing, regulatory pathways and alignment of innovation priorities to improve efficiency in vaccine development pathways. The Vaccine Innovation Prioritization Strategy collaboration presented nine global innovation priorities, and many other partners and members presented updates on their priorities. Novel technologies and platforms, such as RNA-based vaccines, adenoviral vectors, bioconjugation, blow-fill-seal and twodimensional barcodes, provided opportunities to accelerate vaccine innovations. Challenges in planning and operations at global level included those in health security, polio eradication, re-emergence of diseases, disparities between forecasts and orders and heterogeneous regulatory requirements. Manufacturers were urged to accelerate innovation and prequalification of high-impact vaccines, such as pneumococcal, human papillomavirus and rotavirus vaccines, to strengthen immunization globally.",

The vision and strategy reflect health ecosystem responses to changing contexts supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [2] . IA2030 includes two components. The first is the vision of ''a world where everyone, everywhere, at every age fully benefits from vaccines for good health and well-being\" and the associated strategic framework of seven priorities: universal health, commitment and demand, coverage and equity, life-course and integration, outbreaks and emergencies, supply and sustainability, and research and innovation. The second is a collection of resources to support implementation across priorities based on four principles: people focus, country-owned, partnership-based, and datadriven.

CEPI also models vaccine demand and is mapping the global supply network for future stockpiling needs, seeking global diversity and redundancy. Over 270 manufacturers and 70 groups were contacted, including DCVMN members contributing vaccines for preparedness.

Research activities are combined with planning, infrastructure, workforce capacity-building and acceptance, focusing on low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Late-stage development and scale-up for vaccine introduction is capital intensive, and this is where manufacturers with available expertise and facilities can engage as partners. Vaccines are driver of sustainable development [6] .",

Technical cooperation between PAHO and WHO includes evidence-gathering, operational and social aspects to support country decision-making on vaccination, and generate demand. Operations support demand planning, strengthening national budget lines, equipment acquisition, vaccine procurement and delivery through the PAHO Revolving Fund (RF). The RF supports access to vaccines in 41 countries and territories: 25 million people are protected annually with vaccines procured through the RF. The PAHO RF provides each member country, including those transitioned out of Gavi, with equal access to US $10 million in credit. PAHO RF issues annual and multi-annual tenders. Brazil used the fund to cover un-forecasted demand during recent yellow fever outbreaks. In addition, the Brazilian experience of securing access to new vaccines, based on technology transfers to domestic manufacturers, has helped build domestic capacity to overcome global supply shortages. Additional PAHO roles are to strengthen national regulatory authorities, production capacity and collaborations with international partners on vaccine access, particularly for WHO's Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics [7] , and Measles and Rubella initiatives [8] . PAHO recommendations are published regularly [9] .",

            "text": "Etleva Kadilli (UNICEF) highlighted contributions of global immunization at the 30-year anniversary of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child. In 2018, UNICEF procured 2.4 billion vaccine doses, over half produced by DCVMs, which reached 45% of the world's children in 99 countries. Around 65.5 million children received pentavalent (DTPHepBHib) vaccination, reaching 85% coverage. Progress in elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus contrasts with challenges of measles outbreaks in areas of poor coverage, delay in global polio eradication [10] and vaccine hesitancy in high-income countries [11] . The eradication of polio types 2 and 3 marked progress [12] , but type 1 virus circulation persists in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and vaccinederived poliovirus type 2 disease is spreading in Africa due to poor coverage and constrained inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) supply. A novel oral polio type 2 vaccine is in clinical development: 100 million doses are sought for 2020 outbreak responses. Another challenge is access to human papillomavirus vaccines (HPV) for populations most in need. Initiatives to stretch and appropriately direct supply include establishment of a global shortage and product allocation forum. Further, UNICEF is sourcing 0.5 million doses of Ebola vaccine for outbreaks and, after prequalification, for prevention programmes. UNICEF supports countries in building capacity to overcome challenges, on planning, forecasting, financing, budgeting and tendering, for self-procurement and introduction of new vaccines, and publishes strategic market information to improve market dynamics and reduce access asymmetries. Support is available to all countries, regardless of whether countries procure through UNICEF or directly from suppliers.",

            "text": "Seth Berkley (Gavi) reflected on progress since 2000 towards equitable access to vaccines. Gavi's initial portfolio contained 6 vaccines from 5 suppliers in 5 countries. Since then, 430 new vaccine introductions were launched. The current portfolio targets 18 diseases, involving 17 suppliers in 11 countries, impacting affordability and supply security. Coverage for the third dose of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis containing vaccine was 59% and is now 80% in Gavi supported countries, despite population growth (Fig. 3 ). Low-income country (LIC) investments in vaccination increased substantially and are likely to continue. Where three out of five children were vaccinated, four out of five are now. To date, 15 countries transitioned from Gavi support, to selfprocurement or self-manufacturing, most keeping coverage high. Three will transition by 2025, and 10 after that, thus driving more equity in vaccination. By 2030, 70% of under-immunized children will live in middle-income Countries (MICs). Reaching all children requires a different approach and Gavi is exploring avenues to support vaccination in MICs. Gavi is now fostering vaccine introductions in certain MICs, with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), HPV and rotavirus vaccines as priorities. Gavi's next strategic 5-year period will also focus on Global Health Security and the programmatic and forecasting aspects for vaccination against diseases with outbreak potential. New vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are on the horizon, revealing exciting times for vaccine innovation. Nine Steensma (Clinton Health Access Initiative) moderated a panel discussion on vaccine market trends and implications for manufacturers and procurers. Panellists included Etleva Kadilli, John Fitzsimmons (PAHO), Dominique Hein (Gavi), Mauricio Zuma (BioManguinhos) and Suresh Jadhav (Serum Institute of India, SII). As more countries transition from Gavi support, self-procurement may drive increased choice of suppliers and vaccines in future. Manufacturers may encounter different procurers and requirements; procurers may face complexity in building market stability and accurate forecasting. Regional pooled procurement trends may expand. For many manufacturers challenges remain, such as heterogeneous local registration requirements, disparities between forecasts and orders, public pressure to reduce costs, and onerous monitoring commitments. Manufacturers agreed that partners' support will be required to address these challenges.",

Going forward, markets will evolve with greater choice in vaccine characteristics, such as serotypes, dosage, formulation, or wastage. Routine, campaign and outbreak situations in countries at different stages of Gavi support and health system maturity levels create complexity in demand forecasting. Overstocking needs to be balanced with preparedness. The new UNICEF tools of utilization trends, stock flows and reduction of wastage will improve forecast accuracy, irrespective of procurement route. A major contribution of procurement agencies to countries and suppliers is improving market predictability and reliability, for demand planning and financing. Three needs were identified from manufacturer's perspective. The first is on defining country choices for assuring security of vaccine supply. The second is on assuring readiness of the supply system for introducing new vaccines. The third is on providing sustainability of funding from countries graduating from Gavi. Panellists concluded that global information exchange allowed better understanding of risks of shortages. This now needs to expand, with inclusion of highincome countries, to cover fair allocation of supply. This is already done in certain market segments. ",

            "text": "Gerard Cunningham (Global Health Investment Fund) coordinated a panel discussion of investors and manufacturers reflecting on vaccine investment attractiveness and how developing countries' manufacturers can access new sources of capital. Jessica Martinez (Gates Foundation), Younbeen Kim (RIGHT Fund), Jenny Yip (Adjuvant Fund), Peter Khoury (Ology Bioservices) and Sai Prasad (Bharat Biotech) discussed different models used to finance vaccine development. Philanthropic investments are assessed against public health priorities and grants, are based on impact on disease burden, using data from the Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation [16], internal tools, and predictive analytics, to underpin decisions with data. Investors seek recipients that demonstrate long-term commitment to global health. Recent initiatives include the nonprofit Gates Medical Research Institute [17] and the RIGHT Fund [18] , established in 2018 in South Korea in partnership with the Korean government and the Gates Foundation. The Fund generates public investments to support development of new health technologies relevant to LMICs, providing a single channel for funding applications. Clear business cases and manufacturer track records guide investment decisions. Investors focus on global health mind-set and burden-of-disease to manage investments that must provide competitive returns (as opposed to grants) aiming to galvanize resources from non-traditional sources for global health. Investment decisions assess quality of the manufacturer's team, data and corporate finances. Other attributes include manufacturer track record, financial ability and endurance, unique business models and technologies that keep costs low. At Bharat, for example, some vaccines were financed largely internally, with end-stage external funding, such as Japanese encephalitis and typhoid conjugate vaccine, while Rotavac was financed by the Gates Foundation. All three projects had some catalytic funding. The panellists suggested that manufacturers should diversify funding sources to enable risk management, continually evaluate alternatives, understand funding processes and engage in innovation. In turn, funders should make application processes as smooth as possible, with reasonable milestones and timely decision points to support more vaccine manufacturers. Ahn Wartel (International Vaccine Institute, IVI) described partnerships with manufacturers in developing a pipeline for neglected-disease vaccines important for public health, but with limited commercial potential. IVI, in Seoul, has 160 partners including governments, industry, academia, civil society and global organizations, and capacity in laboratory sciences, field programmes, clinical trials, regulatory affairs and training. The most advanced vaccines are oral cholera vaccine, licensed to Eubiologics, and a typhoid conjugate in clinical trials with several manufacturers. Partnerships with manufacturers are sought for seven other candidate vaccines (Fig. 6) . The vision of the Gates Foundation, reiterated by Ray Prasad, is to ensure sustainable supply of high quality, affordable vaccines of greatest impact (Fig. 7) . In partnership with the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing in Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL), a Global Health Fund was launched [19] , based on NIIMBL's 2018 technology roadmap [20] . A call for proposals was recently issued for innovative partnerships to develop in vitro assays to replace animal testing, particularly for polio, rabies and wP vaccines [21] , which are priorities for developing countries.",

Panellists discussed that uncertainty in policy, regulation, finance and operations increase innovator risks which need rebalancing. VIPS offers aligned priorities and clear value propositions. Evolving value propositions were experienced during controlled temperature chain (CTC) implementation. Products had to be understood in each context, as country engagement is critical to success. Some setbacks were encountered, such as CTC approval of a pneumococcal vaccine only used for routine vaccination. Information gathered by VIPS will help avoid similar situations. Innovations often stall because of challenges in predicting demand. Vaccine Vial Monitors (VVMs), for example, took 15 years to implement.

Three rounds of awards supported 35 projects. Three Shigella vaccine candidates employing novel technologies were presented. The most advanced candidate uses bioconjugate technology [35] , where conjugation occurs within a bacterium [36] . The second uses membrane budding technology to produce vaccines [37, 38] . The third is a synthetic conjugate of short O-antigen [39] . Each candidate vaccine requires a manufacturing partner for late-stage clinical development. A Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) for Shigella was developed to facilitate licensure, following cholera and typhoid vaccine precedents. WHO-led stakeholder consultations identified potential licensure routes, although CHIM is not yet considered for LMIC vaccine approval.",

Research within the Future Vaccine Manufacturing Research Hub (FVMR Hub), a donor of DCVMN that is led by Imperial College, London, and directed by Professor Robin Shattock, focuses on four innovative technologies: generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA), baculovirus, yeast, and RNA. The blue text summarizes advantages or strengths of each technology and generalized challenges are shown in orange text. Risk level, indicated by the purple arrow, is categorized according to development stage of each technology. GMMA is the most developed technology, therefore the lowest risk.
