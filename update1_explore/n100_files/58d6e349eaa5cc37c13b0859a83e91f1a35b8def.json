The outbreaks of lethal coronaviruses have taken place for three times within recent two decades (SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019). Much more serious than SARS-CoV in 2002, the current SARS-CoV-2 infection has been spreading to more than 213 countries, areas or territories and causing more than two million cases up to date (17 April 2020). Unfortunately, no vaccine and specific anticoronavirus drugs are available at present time. Current clinical treatment at hand is inadequate to suppress viral replication and inflammation, and reverse organ failure. Intensive research efforts have focused on increasing our understanding of viral biology of SARS-CoV-2, improving antiviral therapy and vaccination strategies. The animal models are important for both the fundamental research and drug discovery of coronavirus. This review aims to summarize the animal models currently available for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and their potential use for the study of SARS-CoV-2.

It was later revealed that the mouse DPP4 receptor differs from human counterpart in crucial domains that is critical to bind the S protein [13] . To overcome the species-specificity barrier for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, human receptor protein (hACE2 or hDPP4) was expressed in mice by knocking in or transfecting a human receptor gene in mouse. The studies of hACE2-transgenic mice were performed at almost the same time in 2007 independently in three groups. [32] .

The S protein of coronaviruses needs to be cleaved by host proteases to be functional. The proteases include endosomal cathepsins, cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) proteases, furin, and trypsin [40] . For example, SARS-CoV-2 uses serine protease, TMPRSS2 in host cell to cleave S protein to activate its entry process [41] . The S protein mutations enhanced infectivity of MERS MA strains by promoting early entry and broadening tissue tropism [42] . Comparing to MERS strain with an uncleaved S protein, MERS MA strain has an S protein that is pre-cleaved by furin of the infected cells and hence achieves a non-endosome cellular entry. Thus, mutations in the protease cleaving site of S protein might alter infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.

First, does age play an important role in disease severity? To know that, an aged mouse model was used for SARS-CoV infection and it was found that SARS-CoV infection in aged mice resulted in increased mortality than that in younger mice. In the studies, 12-14 month old BALB/c or C57BL6 mice developed more severe disease include viral replication, weight loss, ruffled fur and dehydration than that in the 6\u223c12 week-old ones [48] . However, aged 129SvEv mice did not support prolonged pulmonary viral replication and cleared the virus within five days [49] . Interestingly, the SARS MA strain MA15 showed higher mortality in the 9\u223c20 month aged BALB/c and C57BL6 mice than that in the 2\u223c5 month ones [50] . Recently, Yoshikawa et al. demonstrated that the immunopathology degree of MERS-CoV infection in the hDPP4transgenic mouse is age dependent [37] . Mechanistic studies demonstrated that age-dependent increases of phospholipase PLA 2 G2D and dysfunction of CD4 positive T cell could be the reasons for the enhanced SARS-CoV infection [51, 52] . According to epidemiology data, SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to cause severe causes and high mortality in elder people [53] . Overall, the aged mouse model provided an opportunity to study the age-dependent susceptibility of humans to coronavirus. Second, does the gender has impact on infection outcomes? Generally, the males generate mild immune responses and females mount stronger innate and adaptive immune responses and are relatively resistant to virus infections, which explains why males and females showed different response patterns after infection of viruses. Recent studies showed the higher expression of hACE2 in Asian males than the females [54] . Epidemiological data showed gender-specific differences in SARS-CoV infection with males experiencing higher mortality compared to females [55] . This gender-dependent increase in disease severity after pathogenic SARS-CoV infection was more pronounced with advancing age [55] . Male C57BL6 and BALB/c mice showed more susceptible to and higher mortality after SARS-CoV MA15 infection than female mice [50] . In addition, the male mice displayed a higher proinflammatory cytokine levels than female ones, which was is independent of T and B cell responses throughout the SARS-CoV infection course. These clinical and experimental findings imply a higher risk of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the elder Asian males. However, MERS-CoV infection showed no difference between male and female hDPP4-transgenic mice in mortality and weight loss. The epidemiological data of MERS-CoV infection in human with different gender is conflict. Some study showed high incidence and mortality among the males [56] , and others showed that gender may not have impact on the infection outcome of MERS-CoV [5] . Thus, it is necessary to clarify the conflicting results of gender impacts in clinical and experimental studies of MERS-CoV infection. Overall, gender might be an interesting topic for further investigation for the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis. In addition, infection routes and inoculation doses might also have impact on the characteristics of virus shedding, pathogenesis and disease outcomes in experimental animals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 100, "end": 104, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 534, "end": 538, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 661, "end": 665, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 809, "end": 813, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 956, "end": 960, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1152, "text": "[51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1156, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1279, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1817, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1959, "end": 1963, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2092, "end": 2096, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2226, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2821, "end": 2825, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2915, "end": 2918, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Host factors impact on coronavirus infection"}, {"text": "Presumptively, animal models of SARS-CoV might fit for the study of SARS-CoV-2 due to the similarities of the two viruses in pathogenesis, replication, viral characteristics and host receptor for viral entry.

Comparing to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 might be more complicated in transmission and pathogenesis, which makes the animal studies more difficult.

Although many attempts of developing vaccines have been tried, there is currently no approved vaccine for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Several approaches to develop SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines were evaluated in indicated animal models that are summarized in Table 4 . The traditional inactivated virus vaccines use chemicals or radiation to render the viral genome non-infectious while maintaining the virion structure, thus preserving antigenicity but eliminating the potential to cause productive infection. Animal studies have assessed the inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines and found that they can elicit the production of NAbs and inhibit viral replication in NHPs, mice, ferrets and hamsters. However, in some cases, the inactivated vaccine may not arouse enough NAbs for the cover or damage of dominant epitopes [57] . Moreover, the inactivated vaccines might lack adequate cross-protection among different viral strains, especially for the unknown and newly identified strains. Live-attenuated vaccines are produced by reducing or eliminating the virulence of a live virus, typically using chemical-driven, site mutation or gene deletion. Although the live-attenuated vaccine can elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses in mice and hamsters, risk of phenotypic or genotypic reversion and disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients limit further translation [1] . Among all the functional structural proteins of coronavirus, the S protein is an important antigen that might effectively inducing NAbs to block viral binding and entry, as well as stimulating robust host immune responses [58] . Therefore, the S protein has been designed as the main target for the development of SARS vaccines by different strategies including developing a S subunit, using an expression vector, packaging a virus-like particle, delivering a DNA plasmid and nanoparticle [3] . These vaccine strategies showed protection effects in different animals (Table 4) . However, they are limited by the possibilities of incomplete protection, the risk of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) include expanded infection, tissue destruction, cytokine storm and multiple organ failure [3] . The mechanism of ADE effect is complicated and not yet clearly clarified. Serum of inactivated SARS-CoV and S protein immunized mice, as well as the S protein specific antibodies were demonstrated to promote viral infection and cytopathogenesis in human immune cells such as macrophage and B lymphocytes, via a pH-and cysteine protease-independent Fc\u03b3 receptor pathway [59] . Moreover, S protein specific antibodies treatment caused fatal acute lung injury in SARS-CoV infected NHPs by skewing macrophage mediated inflammation-resolving responses [60] . In addition, prior immunization with N protein might also cause severe pneumonia in mice infected with live SARS-CoV [61] . Indeed, many studies showed that virus-like particle, inactivated virus vaccine, rDNA-produced S protein vaccine led to occurrence of pulmonary and Th2-type immunopathology on challenge with live SARS-CoV in mice, suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced [57, 62] . Similar lung immunopathology was also observed in mice immunized with inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine [63] .
