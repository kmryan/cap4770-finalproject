This data is updated every day and is available for most countries from multiple sources such as [Gar20b, iD20] . In this work we present a two step procedure for model fitting to Covid-19 data. In the first step, time dependent transmission coefficients are constructed directly from the data and, in the second step, measures of those (minimum, maximum, mean, median etc.,) are used to set priors for fitting models to data. We call this approach a \"data driven approach\" or \"data first approach\". This scheme is complementary to Bayesian approach and can be used with or without that for parameter estimation. We use the procedure to fit a set of SIR and SIRD models, with time dependent contact rate, to Covid-19 data for a set of 45 most affected countries. We find that SIR and SIRD models with constant transmission coefficients cannot fit Covid-19 data for most countries (mainly because social distancing, lockdown etc., make those time dependent). We find that any time dependent contact rate, which falls gradually with time, can help to fit SIR and SIRD models for most of the countries. We also present constraints on transmission coefficients and basic reproduction number R 0 as well as effective reproduction number R(t). The main contributions of our work are as follows.

Compartmental models, such as SIR, SIRD, SEIR etc., help to simplify the problem by replacing a large number of controlling parameters with a very small set of well motivated parameters -the transmission coefficients.The compartmental models predict that how the population in different compartments change with time. In the SIR model the population in S and R compartments can only decrease and increase respectively, however, in the I compartment it can increases as well as decreases. On the onset of the epidemic almost everyone is in the S compartment with a very small fraction in I and no one in the R compartment.
