Some events have been postponed or even re-postponed; in other cases, organizers have decided that the uncertainty surrounding the lifting of restrictions is too great and they have therefore cancelled the 2020 editions of their events. Additional changes from those noted in the previous issue ['Focus on Surfactants', Mar 2020] are highlighted here.",
