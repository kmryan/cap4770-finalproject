(Zhang et al., 2011) , the present models of infectious disease transmission can be divided into three categories according to the, which are single group model (treat the population as a whole), the composite group model (divide population into child groups according to the spatial heterogeneity) and individual models (consider attributes and behaviors of individuals). The SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1991) proposed in 1927 is a classical single group model, in which the population was treated as a whole and partial differential equations was adopted to describe the relationship between healthy population, infected population, recovering population and dead population. Besides, the concept of average contact number was introduced and they pointed out that the average contact number was the key factor affecting the spread of infectious diseases. Another single group model proposed by Hoppensteadt et al. (1975) considered the effect of age heterogeneity on the transmission. Random factors were then introduced by some studies (Black and McKane, 2010; N\u00e5sell, 2002) , and these models were more effective than deterministic models in exploring the characteristics of the early stage of a infectious diseases and the recurring infectious disease. Composite group models divide the population into different subgroups according to clearly defined social units. With the hypothesis, this kind of models are able to investigate the transmission of infectious diseases caused by personnel movement in different areas with the help of the graph theory. Cross et al. (2007) established a 11\uf0cd11 grid model. A SIR model was adopted in the each grid. Another composite group model was proposed by Colizza and Vespignani (2008) to obtain threshold conditions for epidemic infection, in which a SIR model was used to describe flows within subgroups, and a network was used to describe links between subgroups. Watts et al. (2005) treated the population as a hierarchical structure and established a composite group model to discuss the impact of hierarchy on the transmission.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 32, "end": 52, "text": "(Zhang et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 419, "end": 449, "text": "(Kermack and McKendrick, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 935, "end": 961, "text": "Hoppensteadt et al.
