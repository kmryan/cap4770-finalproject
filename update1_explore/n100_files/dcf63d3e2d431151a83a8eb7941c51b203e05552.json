Early clinical signs may be diffi cult for owners to appreciate until the signs have become severe. Therefore, dyspnoeic cats are frequently presented as acute emergencies. Investigations to discover the underlying aetiology must be balanced with the status of the cat (Tseng and Waddell 2000) as stress can be detrimental in these patients. Frequently supportive treatment and stabilisation of the patient is necessary before further investigations can be undertaken.",

            "text": "Feline dyspnoea can be due to upper airway disease, lower airway disease, pulmonary parenchymal disease, pleural disease, mediastinal disease, cardiac diseases, thoracic damage and extra-thoracic diseases. Upper airway disease includes stenotic nares, rhinitis, nasal neoplasia, laryngeal disease and tracheal lesions (Schachter and Norris 2000, Jakubiak and others 2005) . Lower airway diseases include extraluminal airway compression, foreign bodies, chronic bronchitis/asthma and smoke inhalation others 1995, Foster and others 2004) . Pulmonary parenchymal disorders include bronchopneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, intrapulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary thromboembolism and pulmonary neoplasia (Ohn and others 2004 , Schermerhorn and others 2004 , Grandi and others 2005 . Pleural diseases, most commonly pleural effusions, have a variety of aetiologies, including infectious [for example, feline coronavirus infection or feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), bacterial pyothorax], neoplastic or cardiac. Mediastinal disease includes neoplasia, toxins (for example, paraquat and warfarin poisoning) and infections. Common neoplastic causes are lymphoma and thymoma (Patnaik and others 2003, Jakubiak and others 2005) . Cardiac disease includes acquired disease (particularly the cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, unclassifi ed and arrhythmogenic right ventricular primary forms, and secondary cardiomyopathies) and congenital cardiac diseases (Ferasin and others 2003 , Chetboul and others 2006 , Schrope and Kelch 2007 . Dyspnoea in cardiac disease is usually associated with pulmonary oedema or pleural effusion. However, congenital right to left shunting cardiac defects may result in dyspnoea due to chronic hypoxaemia. Thoracic damage can result in dyspnoea from pleural effusion, pneumothorax, diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary contusions OBJECTIVES: Dyspnoea is an unspecifi c severe presenting sign, which can be life threatening and requires prompt treatment. Dyspnoeic cats often have signifi cant underlying disease. Underlying aetiologies in cats that presented with dyspnoea were reviewed, and associations with patient signalment and outcome were investigated.",

However, this fi gure includes 10 of the 13 cats that died or were euthanased because of poor long-term prognosis. Cats were signifi cantly older than those of other groups, as was found in previous studies (Patnaik and others 2003, Jakubiak and others 2005) . Most cats in this group were diagnosed with lymphoma (6/12 in which a defi nitive diagnosis was made, 50 per cent) and seemed to show better survival than other neoplasms as four of these cats survived to discharge. Thoracic involvement in 13 per cent lymphoma cases with a median survival of 885 days has been reported (Tzannes and others 2008) . A previous study found an association with Siamese cats and lymphoma (Jakubiak and others 2005) , but only one cat of the present study was Siamese (with tracheal lymphoma).",
