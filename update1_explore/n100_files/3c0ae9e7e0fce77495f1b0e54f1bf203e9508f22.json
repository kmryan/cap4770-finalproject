Further, high blood pressure, thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and catastrophic course leads to suggest that the virus is also targeting the endothelium (5, 6) .

Understanding immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 is very important for developing efficient treatment regimens. There are a rapidly increasing number of clinical investigations of cell-based therapy approaches for COVID-19. Moreover, a variety of anti-inflammatory agent that can reduce the entry of the virus into the cell, various antivirals studied for other viruses, anticoagulants, vitamins, antibiotics, immune system modulators and immune plasma are applied. Likewise, working towards the development of vaccines against COVID-19continues rapidly/intensely(2,3).",
