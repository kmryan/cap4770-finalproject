Synthetic peptides corresponding to each of its three individual transmembrane domains (TMDs) are reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers. Only TMD2 and TMD3 induce channel activity. Reconstitution of the peptides as TMD1 1 TMD3 as well as TMD2 1 TMD3 in a 1 : 1 mixture induces membrane activity for both mixtures. In a 1 : 1 : 1 mixture, channel like behavior is almost restored. Expression of full length 3a and reconstitution into artificial lipid bilayers reveal a weak cation selective (P K 2 P Cl ) rectifying channel. In the presence of nonphysiological concentration of Ca-ions the channel develops channel activity. V C 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 99: 628-635, 2013.",

            "text": "T he synthesis of a membrane protein is literally done in a \"densely packed environment.\" Starting from the ribosomal mantle the developing amino acid chain is transferred via the translocon into the lipid membrane. Within these confined environments the extramembrane parts of the protein is folded and the protein as a monomer is released. In the case of ion channels the monomers need to meet other monomers to finally adopt a quaternary fold in an either homo-or hetero oligomeric assembly. There is not very much information about how this last step is achieved, but it is envisaged that a diffusion driven movement within the lipid membrane is required to find the \"mates\" and to form a channel. With this in mind, the question arises whether the TMDs of a polytopic membrane protein would be able to self-assemble on it's own without the help of a translocon machinery? Also, would self-assembly allow generating higher structural order? Knowing the answers to the latter question would allow the manufacturing of complex biomolecules or design novel folds. 1, 2 A key feature in manufacturing proteins and peptides is the knowledge about the role of individual amino acids in the mechanism of function of the final protein [3] [4] [5] and how self-assembly works and can be manipulated accordingly. 1, 6 Man-made production of proteins usually starts in a \"noncrowded\" environment compared to the assembly in the cell. Protein or peptides and the lipids are simply mixed and left to assemble according to the environmental conditions. These conditions may not reflect those conditions within the living cell.",

The 3a protein is a 274 amino acid protein which forms a homo tetrameric potassium sensitive ion channel assembly. 20 The protein is also part of a series of auxiliary proteins encoded by this virus. 21 It is the largest viral channel forming protein found to date. 15 Lowering the level of 3a expression in FRhK-4 cells with siRNA when infected with SARS-CoV, leads to a reduced release of new virus particles. The protein is also involved in the upregulation of the expression of fibrinogen in human lung epithelial cell lines 22 and activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB). 23 3a is proposed to harbor three helical TMDs. 20, 24 In a computational approach first structural models of the monomer and the tetrameric channel are proposed. 24, 25 Depending on the route of assembly, either the second (TMD2) or the third TMD (TMD3) is proposed to line the putative pore. Experimental data on the structure of the protein in any form is still lacking. Emodin, a plant derived drug, is proposed to inhibit channel activity of 3a. 26 Peptides corresponding to the proposed TMDs are synthesized and reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayer (see also Refs. 27, 28) . The TMDs are either investigated individually or in a series of mixtures to assess their contribution forming the lumen of the pore. Full length protein 3a is expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and also reconstituted into lipid bilayers to investigate biophysical characteristics such as ion selectivity and gating kinetics.",

As solid support H-Rink Amide-ChemMatrix resin (190 mg, loading 0.52 mmol g 21 ) from pcas Biomatrix was used. All amino acids were coupled according to standard methodologies in an automated single coupling mode (75 C, 300 s) Fmoc deprotection was carried out with 20% piperidine in NMP (75 C, 180 s). Cleavage of crude peptides from the resin was accomplished through treatment with 95% TFA 2.5% water, 2.5% TIPS for 1.5 or 3.5 h in case of Arg containing peptides. Preparative purification by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out on a Shimadzu LC-8A system with a VariTide RPC column (21.2 3 250 mm 2 ) and a water/acetonitrile system (Buffer A: 0.2% TFA in water, Buffer B: 0.2% TFA in water:acetonitrile, 1:4). The peptides TMD1 and TMD2 were purified by washing with Acetonitril and MeOH, because of the bad solubility of the peptides. The purified peptides were dried by lyophilization and characterized by analytical HPLC and mass spec analysis.",

            "text": "A common method to analyze channel forming peptides and ion channels is to reconstitute them into free standing artificial bilayers. The bilayer consists of mixtures of lipids which are indented to mimic the natural environment. 32 With the technique used in this study, it is assumed that this membrane is slightly thicker than the natural membrane due to the solvent (hexane/decane) used during the preparation of the lipids. Peptide and protein diffusivity in the membrane is dependent on the interplay between peptides/proteins and the lipid bilayer. Hydrophobic miss match, peptide/protein concentration and lipid composition affect migration, as well as translational and rotational diffusivity. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] The diffusivity of artificial peptides (e.g., WALP15 37 ) within an artificial lipid membrane is also found to be higher than for larger full length proteins (e.g., class II MHC membrane proteins 38 ) . With this in mind it is anticipated that individual peptides, as used in the present study, should be able to screen the full conformational space laterally and rotationally and assemble into the \"proper\" form for ion conductance. Finally, the assembly process consists of a competition of even weak interhelical interactions despite any specific protein-protein binding motifs. 39, 40 In the present study the TMDs are individually tested for channel activity. With this approach, one TMD, TMD1, can be excluded from being channel active in a way. In a 1 : 1 combination of TMD1, with either TMD2 or TMD3, the combination with TMD2 silences channel activity as well. This behavior could either result from a tight binding of the two TMDs into a conformation which does not allow the TMDs to form into a pore like ensemble or altered dynamics as a dimer. In the TMD1 : TMD3 mixture, TMD3 is left in a state to exhibit membrane activity with a recording pattern that seems to be unaffected compared to the pattern found only for TMD3. This finding allows the interpretation that TMD1 and TMD3 move almost independently from each other or that in the case of interaction, a pore lining motive in TMD3 is not affected. TMD2 and TMD3 together retain channel activity similar to their individual recordings, allowing proposing, that both of them are involved in channeling ions across the membrane and could be involved in mantling the pore of the channel protein.",

Four of the monomers are then aligned simultaneously to generate the channel. With the monomer being aligned in a sequential manner TMD2 points into the lumen of the putative channel. With the simultaneous alignment of the monomer a model suggesting TMD3 as the pore lining helix is obtained. Even though it is suggested that TMD2 is most likely the pore lining TMD, contribution of TMD3 in mantling the lumen cannot fully be ruled out.",

Without the loops, none of them is emphatically preferred during the assembly process. Thus, the assembly can be depicted as a weakly structured \"many hole golf course,\" following Levinthal's idea of \"golf course landscape\" in protein folding. 43 Studies on using peptides corresponding to TMDs of polytopic channel proteins have been reported in the literature to evaluate their functional role in the channel (see an early review 18 ).",
