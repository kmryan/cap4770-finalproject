The assay utilized primers targeting ISAV RNA segment 8, with ISAV isolate U5575-1 as template. The entire optimized assay, including one cycle of reverse transcription, 50 cycles of complementary DNA amplification, and data acquisition and analysis took only 80 min. The melting curve and gel electrophoresis analyses of real-time RT-PCR showed harmony with each other as a virus-specific single melting peak and a product of the expected size of 211 bp were obtained. A regression line between the mean threshold cycle (Ct) values and viral template concentrations over a 1:10 5 dilution range with an r 2 value of 0.962 and a slope of \u22123.771 indicated that the assay was highly reproducible. This assay was 100 times more sensitive than the conventional one-tube RT-PCR assay when compared on the same sample. Analysis of different tissues from fish that survived an ISAV experimental infection further confirmed that real-time RT-PCR was more sensitive than regular RT-PCR for detection of ISAV nucleic acids. Temporal analysis of ISAV-infected TO cell cultures showed that the amount of the specific viral RNA increased more than 100-fold within 32 h post-inoculation (p.i.) and over 1200-fold by 144 h p.i. The melting curve analysis throughout the duration of the infection sampled had a single melting peak suggesting that the virus population was uniform in the targeted region. Quantitative analysis of CHSE-214 cell cultures infected with different ISAV isolates indicated that ISAV isolates, based on their ability to replicate and cause cytopathic effects in CHSE-214 cells, may be differentiated into three CHSE phenotypes: replicating cytopathic, replicating non-cytopathic, and non-replicating. Thus, the SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR is a sensitive, rapid, and highly reproducible assay that can be used to quantitate ISAV in biological samples.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus (ISAV) causes an economically important and highly fatal disease of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) characterized by high mortality, severe anemia, exophthalmia, petechial hemorrhages in the visceral fat and skin, and hemorrhagic hepatic necrosis and kidney tubular necrosis and interstitial hemorrhages (Byrne et al., 1998; Dannevig et al., 1993; Evensen and Thorud, 1991; Falk and Dannevig, 1995; Falk et al., 1997; Hovland et al., 1994; Speilberg et al., 1995) .

The results are summarized in Table 7 . ISAV isolate NBISA01 was used as the positive control for virus replication with CPE production in CHSE-214 cells (Kibenge et al., 2000) . ISAV isolate U5575-1 served as the negative control for virus replication in CHSE-214 cells as demonstrated above. NBISA01 was the only ISAV isolate that produced CPE in CHSE-214 cells; the CPE was first observed on day 8 post-infection. The melting curve analysis indicated that the real-time RT-PCR products were virus-specific. The results further showed that there was a significant difference (P \u2264 0.05) among the mean Ct values of genomic RNA levels in CHSE-214 cells at different times post-infection for NBISA01 and HKS-36 suggesting that these two isolates do replicate in the CHSE-214 cell line.
