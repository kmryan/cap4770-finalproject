Diabetic Foot Clinic remains accessible as these patients usually require early 85 attention; ii) significant reduction in routine anesthesia support (to free up this 86 valuable resource for intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilation service); iii) reduced 87 high-risk surgery listing in order to conserve intensive resources e.g. we postponed a 88 case of migrated thoracic stent which is to be remedied with a customised thoracic 89 arch branch device as there is an inherent increased risk of aortic dissection or 90 stroke necessitating ICU stay; iv) exposure protection for admitted patients who are 91 5 at increased risk for COVID-19 mortality 4 ; v) lastly, manpower redeployment (nurses 92 and doctors to augment COVID-19 work in NCID). 93 94 In our institution, the endovascular service is provided jointly by vascular surgery (VS) 95 and interventional radiology (IR). Apart from access to NCID angiography suite, 96 there are two angiography systems sited within radiology department.
