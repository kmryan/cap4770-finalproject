Unfortunately, knowledge about the extrapulmonary involvement is scarce, and it is of utmost importance that every previously unknown clinical expression is promptly reported, in order to assist other clinicians who could again meet it, and to allow to better understand the pathogenesis of a still elusive infectious syndrome.",

            "text": "Open access dIscussIon Intramural bowel gas, also known as PI, refers to the intraoperative or radiological finding of the presence of gas within the wall of the bowel. PI is a rare condition, whose incidence is difficult to ascertain since most patients are asymptomatic, with a clinical spectrum encompassing from benign to life-threatening forms. 7 8 PI can be a primary (idiopathic) and benign form accounting for about 15% of cases, often incidentally detected in CT scan as multiple gas-filled cysts in the mucosa and submucosa of the small and/or large bowel. The secondary PI forms account for the remaining 85% of cases, and are associated with several conditions, such as chronic bowel ischaemia, obstructive and necrotic GI diseases, obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, systemic autoimmune diseases, 9 inflammatory bowel diseases, 10 organ transplantation, barotrauma (during ventilation) and other iatrogenic causes (post endoscopy/colonoscopy, post surgery), and use of some medications, including corticosteroids and chemotherapeutic agents. 11 Very uncommonly PI presents as a pneumoperitoneum (less than 3%). 12 Occasionally, portal venous gas can be detected in case of mesenteric ischaemia. The following imaging findings have been reported as indicative of a clinically worrisome PI: lesser extent of pneumatosis, free peritoneal fluid, soft-tissue bowel wall thickening, and periintestinal soft-tissue stranding; on the contrary, distribution, free peritoneal air, and characteristic morphology (linear vs cystic) did not indicate a more unfavourable prognosis. 13 The pathogenesis of PI is poorly understood, and is probably multifactorial. In course of enteritis, or in patients with immunodeficiency, the gut microbiota can be altered, and PI might result from intraluminal gas produced by the overgrowth of gas-forming bacteria, with subsequent gas diffusion in the submucosa. The gas could enter the bowel wall due to the coexistence of increased intraluminal pressure, mucosal disruption and increased permeability; moreover, also the excessive hydrogen production due to bacterial overgrowth could lead to gas supersaturation, overwhelming the capability of diffusion into the bloodstream, and consequent generation of gas-containing cystic formations. 8 It is known that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the digestive tract through the enterocytes of the ileum and colon 3 ; however, to our best knowledge, SARS-CoV-2 has never been related with occurrence of PI.",

It should be noted that the cough was already resolved when the PI finding was not yet present at the first CT examination. The treatment with lactulose has been rarely associated with the occurrence of reversible idiopathic PI in patients with liver cirrhosis, 14 and lactitol (a disaccharide analogue of lactulose) has been reported as probable cause of recurrent PI associated with benign pneumoperitoneum even in patients without cirrhosis history 15 : because of the duration of treatment (only 6 days) and the low dose administered (average daily dose 25 mL), it is unlikely that lactulose can be the cause of PI in our non-cirrhotic patient.",
