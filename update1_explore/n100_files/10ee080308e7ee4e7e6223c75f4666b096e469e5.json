            "text": "The occurrence of microorganisms in water due to contamination is a health risk and control thereof is a necessity. Conventional detection methods may be misleading and do not provide rapid results allowing for immediate action. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method has proven to be an effective tool to detect and quantify microorganisms in water within a few hours. Quantitative PCR assays have recently been developed for the detection of specific adeno-and polyomaviruses, bacteria and protozoa in different water sources. The technique is highly sensitive and able to detect low numbers of microorganisms. Quantitative PCR can be applied for microbial source tracking in water sources, to determine the efficiency of water and wastewater treatment plants and act as a tool for risk assessment. Different qPCR assays exist depending on whether an internal control is used or whether measurements are taken at the end of the PCR reaction (end-point qPCR) or in the exponential phase (real-time qPCR). Fluorescent probes are used in the PCR reaction to hybridise within the target sequence to generate a signal and, together with specialised systems, quantify the amount of PCR product. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR) is a more sensitive technique that detects low copy number RNA and can be applied to detect, e.g. enteric viruses and viable microorganisms in water, and measure specific gene expression. There is, however, a need to standardise qPCR protocols if this technique is to be used as an analytical diagnostic tool for routine monitoring. This review focuses on the application of qPCR in the detection of microorganisms in water.",

Monitoring of microorganisms in water therefore involves the use of different techniques including the use of indicator and index bacteria such as faecal coliforms [4] . Examples of faecal indicators include Escherichia coli, Enterococci [5] , Bacteroidetes spp. [4] , Candida spp. [6] , adenoviruses and polyomaviruses [7] . However, the reliability of these indicators is questioned. The quantity of indicator microorganisms may differ from the actual number of pathogens [8] , infectious doses between the microorganisms may vary [8] and in some cases the microorganisms are viable but nonculturable [9] . Microbial source tracking indicators are for example useful for pinpointing pollution sources of groundwater, used as a drinking water supply.",

The methods of quantitation of the amplicons and type of standard used in the assay determine the strategy for qPCR. Different approaches include the use of internal and external standards for competitive or non-competitive assays, respectively [15] . Two methods are used for qPCR, namely endpoint PCR and real-time PCR. During end-point PCR a measurement is taken after completion of the entire PCR reaction to calculate the amount of template present prior to PCR. Real-time PCR takes measurements at the exponential phase of the PCR and is a more sensitive and reproducible method [16] . Different protocols exist for real-time PCR, including relative qPCR and absolute measurements, and small differences in variables may influence the final accumulation and quality of PCR products [17] .",

Recently it was shown that human adenoviruses can persist, for extensive time periods, in natural environmental conditions [43, 44] . The fact that adenoviruses are doublestranded DNA viruses is related to their prolonged persistence in environmental water sources compared to singlestranded RNA viruses [45, 46] . Polyomaviruses are also double-stranded DNA viruses and have been investigated as a possible viral indicator for monitoring water quality [47, 48] .",

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever caused by S. typhi and S. paratyphi respectively are responsible for 17 million cases annually. Humans can be carriers of Salmonella spp. even after recovery from typhoid fever because small numbers of the bacteria can persist [62] . Epidemic cholera is caused by the serogroups V. cholerae O1 and O39 that produce the cholera toxin. Cholera is associated with watery diarrhoea and if left untreated could lead to rapid dehydration and death in 50-70 % of the cases [63] . C. jejuni, C. coli, pathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli strains, and Y. enterocolitica are all agents for diarrhoea [61] . Legionella spp. are opportunistic human pathogens that proliferate in warm waters which support the growth of certain serogroups. These serogroups, once aerosolised, can be inhaled by humans resulting in subsequent legionnaires' disease and Pontaic fever [64] .",

Reference genes include endogenous [76] or exogenous [77] mRNA targets that are assayed separately or together with the unknown target followed by the evaluation of the final ratio [78] . The two genes should be analysed in the same PCR assay to improve the reliability of the method [12] . The calibration sample is used to evaluate a biological effect in terms of per cent variation in comparison to a basal condition. The main approach is to determine the changes in gene expression by varying the experimental conditions in in vitro studies [12] . In this case the difficult process to develop accurate RNA standards is avoided by using a comparative quantification method. The method is based on the fact that the difference in threshold cycles between the target gene and the housekeeping gene is proportional to the relative gene expression level of the target gene [73] .",

The most accurate procedure is to add a known amount of the competitor to each assay tube to ensure the amplification of the two species at the same rate.

Examples are the inclusion of a new restriction site in the native sequence [80] and insertion of a slightly modified nucleotide sequence [82] . However, a simpler method is to modify the size of the competitor in the range of 10-15 % by introducing a short deletion or insertion.

The assay should be repeated up to 10 times to ensure the reproducibility of the curve and thereby to extract highly specific data [83] . A reference DNA sequence is added both to the DNA from the unknown test sample and the calibration sample. The relative quantity of DNA sequences of the two samples can therefore be determined [84] . The cycle threshold (C T ) is determined automatically by the instrument after the threshold fluorescence value is manually set. For every assay the difference in C T of the reference sequence assay and that of the target sequence assay is determined. The difference in the mean values of the calibration tests and the calibration samples are then calculated (\u0394\u0394CT). The amplification efficiency (E) of the target assay can then be determined by the formula E \u00fe 1 \u00f0 \u00de \u00c0\u0394\u0394C T . The estimated number of target organism cells in the test sample is calculated by multiplying these ratios by the known number of target organism cells [25] . When a microorganism cannot be cultivated, plasmid DNA standards are preferably used. They are also designed to function as internal amplification controls in multiplex assays to monitor for amplification inhibitors [85] . The advantages of using plasmid preparations are that the standards are of high quality, are pure and can be converted to the number of copies of target DNA. The assumption is made that the amplification efficiency of plasmid and genomic DNA is similar. However, a few strategies have been used to treat the genomic DNA e.g. cocktail of restriction enzymes or by ultrasonification so that the two types of DNA can be equilibrated [86] . The disadvantage of using plasmid DNA is that environmental samples are fully extracted and purified leading to inconsistent DNA recovery due to variance in the replicate extracts and unauthentic results [87] .",

Fluorogenic probes hybridise within the target sequence to generate a signal that accumulates during PCR cycling proportional to the concentration of amplification products. The signal is associated with the amplified target that in turn quantifies the amount of PCR products [107] . Fluorescence can be measured at the end of PCR (end-point fluorescence) or measured during the amplification phase (real-time PCR). In real-time PCR quantification takes place early, in the exponential amplification phase of the reaction. This close-tube system requires no post-treatment of the PCR products that reduces the changes of PCR contamination [14] .

Dual-labeled fluorogenic hybridisation probes are used, including a reporter dye i.e. FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) covalently linked to the 5\u2032 end whose emission spectra is quenched by a second dye i.e. TAMRA (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine), covalently linked to the 3\u2032 end. During a PCR cycle, the probe specifically hybridises to the corresponding template, cleaves via the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase and subsequently increases the FAM fluorescent emission [108] . The increase in fluorescence is proportional to the amount of specific PCR product as the exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase acts only if the fluorogenic probe is annealed to the target [12] (Fig. 1) . The TaqMan assay can be applied for end-point and realtime measurements of PCR products. End-point measurements are only for qualitative applications i.e. presence or absence of a nucleic acid target. In real-time PCR, the fluorescence spectra are continuously measured during PCR amplification by a sequence detector [12, 13] .",

Complementary stem sequences are on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the probe with the fluorophore in the immediacy of the quencher [71] . After amplification and incorporation of the hairpin probe, the loop sequence of the resultant amplicon is complementary to the probe. During each cycle of denaturation and annealing, the probe is free to bind to the complementary sequence, leading to the separation of the fluorophore and quencher and resulting in an increase in fluorescence. The PCR stopper in the hairpin prevents the stem-loop structure from being copied during PCR by extension from the other primer [71] .",

Therefore the microorganisms are normally concentrated by membrane filtration to a detectable number [35] . Tangential-flow, hollow-fibre ultrafiltration has recently showed promising results in concentrating pathogens in one process [112, 113] . Viruses in water samples from wastewater treatments plants have been concentrated through centrifugation steps before the re-dissolved pellets are filtered [23] . Viruses in water samples can be extracted by using glass wool columns [7] , pre-acidified glass wool columns [114] , ultrafiltration cartridges [115] , electropositive cartridges [47] and ultracentrifugation [35] . The first two methods are the most cost-effective with acceptable recoveries of viruses, whereas electropositive cartridges have higher cost and cannot be used for turbid water samples and ultracentrifugation is only applicable for small volumes of heavily polluted water [7] . DNA can be extracted by a variety of DNA kits in combination with bead beating depending on the tested microorganism [4, 24] . Cell lysates can also successfully be used with the same reproducibility of purified DNA and involves less labour [11] . The genomic segment(s) to be amplified is (are) then selected and the optical tubes containing the reaction mixtures are subjected to thermal cycles that vary between 1 h and 15 min to 2 h and 45 min [6, 22, 24, 69, 116] .

[4, 24] developed a qPCR assay to detect human-specific and ruminant-specific Bacteriodetes markers (BacH and BacR) in spring water in alpine karstic regions. The BacH assay could detect human faeces as low as 100 pg per volume of water. The detection limit of the BacR assay was 1.7\u00d710 \u22129 g per analysed filter. The assay met the requirements for MST in the alpine karstic spring water and was used to pinpoint the source of pollution. The use of qPCR assays can therefore assist in determining critical control points from source to tap to ensure safe drinking water.

Traditional methods used for the detection of E. coli O157:H7, a bacterial pathogen in water, takes about 3 to 5 days. An alternative method is the use of PCR assays although other pathogenic or non-pathogenic E. coli strains are also detected. A method is therefore required that would ideally be rapid and specific for the viable and stressed pathogenic isolates of E. coli O157:H7. Sen et al. [119] developed a culture-qPCR assay to detect stressed E. coli O157:H7 in source and finished drinking water. The assay takes 24 h from collection to detection and entails an enrichment step to allow growth of stressed cells followed by two triplex qPCR assays.",

            "text": "The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was the first to determine the relationship between illness rates in swimmers and faecal indicator concentrations by using qPCR as one of the methods. Quantitative PCR was compared to EPA Method 1600 membrane filter (MF) analysis to measure the faecal pollution indicator genus Enterococcus at two recreational beaches during the summer of 2003 [25] . The qPCR method showed similar results and could therefore replace the MF method [25] . These results were confirmed in a study that investigated the relationship between qPCR and culturing techniques in the detection of Enterococcus spp. in surface water collected from 37 sites [120] . A linear relationship between the two techniques was observed at high levels of contamination [120] . The reproducibility of qPCR in the detection of the faecal bacteria, Enterococcus and Bacteroidales, was compared between eight different facilities, including the US EPA [118] . Only small variations in results between the laboratories were observed [118] . A qPCR assay for the rapid identification of Bacteroides fragilis has also been developed to indicate faecal pollution in recreational waters [121] . A higher relative error in replicate qPCR assays was observed than during replicate culturing techniques. This emphasizes the need to further optimise qPCR assays for routine analysis of environmental samples, taking into account sample variability, different pollution sources and environmental factors [120] . The relationship between gastrointestinal illnesses among swimmers and the presence of Enterococcus spp. in surface water has been well established with qPCR in fresh [122, 123] and marine water beaches [124] and can assist authorities in preventing potential disease outbreaks in public recreational areas.

Discrepancies between qPCR and cultivation techniques were larger for E. coli and Salmonella spp. than for C. perfringens. Discrepancies were also smaller for E. coli and Salmonella spp. in dewatered sludge and in the supernatant after centrifugation than in the wastewater, pretreated wastewater and treated water [24] . Reischer et al. [4, 24] developed human-specific and ruminant-specific Bacteroidetes markers (BacH and BacR) to be used in qPCR assays for MST studies. Although the results of these assays could successfully be used to pinpoint sources of pollution, the persistence of these faecal DNA markers in different environments should be tested in future studies.

PCR inhibitors in environmental water samples, including heavy metals, humic acids and phenolic compounds, could lead to the underestimation of microorganisms present. This is especially a problem when microorganisms are present in low concentrations [145] . Diluting DNA or RNA concentrations before qPCR has been used to remove PCR inhibitors in water collected from various sources including surface water, wastewater and drinking water [146] . In the qPCR assay for the detection of Candida spp. in water, Brinkman et al. [6] found that samples with high turbidity should be diluted up to a 100 times to overcome PCR inhibition. In some cases additional DNA purification was required that caused a tenfold loss of DNA. Water samples from different sources may therefore affect the sensitivity of qPCR. However, this could lead to increased variations in gene copy numbers or false negatives if the DNA or RNA concentrations are diluted below their detection limit [147, 148] . Researchers have developed protocols that remove PCR inhibitors during extraction including methods utilizing phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol [149] , AlNH 4 (SO 4 ) 2 [150] and the polymeric absorbent Superlite\u2122 DAX-8 [151] . Commercial DNA extraction kits have also been shown to remove PCR inhibitors in environmental water samples for successful qPCR [83] .

After disinfection, qPCR results were not comparable with results obtained with cultivation methods. The researchers suggested that EMA could not penetrate some of the cells in the chlorinated samples [127, 153] . EMA-qPCR assays to detect viable Legionella species in spa water [154] , tap water [155] and cooling water [156] have also been developed.

In other words, as previously discussed, it cannot discriminate between viable and non-viable microorganisms. The EA and academic institutions compared the efficiency of conventional faecal indicators with the accredited EA qPCR method to determine whether the data obtained from this qPCR method could be solely used for making regulatory decisions. Crude sewage, secondary treated sewage and UVdisinfected sewage were collected from Scarborough Wastewater Treatment Works and analysed using both methods. After UV treatment a significant decrease in the colony forming units (CFU) of faecal coliforms and presumptive intestinal enterococci was observed. However, no significant decrease was observed in the genome copies of Bacteroidales after UV treatment (Fig. 4) . Researchers therefore advise that qPCR cannot be used as the sole detection method for routine analysis of environmental water samples [168] .",

The advantages of LAMP include a single reaction temperature ranging between 60 and 65\u00b0C, high specificity by using six primers that can recognise eight distinct regions and lack of DNA purification due to tolerance to inhibitory materials [172] [173] [174] . Detection of the products is visually assessed as a large amount of DNA is synthesised in a short time resulting in the production of pyrophosphate that forms white precipitates of magnesium pyrophosphate leading to turbidity [175] . An increase in turbidity indicates an increase in precipitate production and correlates with the amount of DNA [172, 174] . The method is therefore cost-effective as expensive equipment is not necessary [172, 176, 177] .

This method is also named self-sustained sequence replication (3SR) [183] . Gel electrophoresis, fluorescence probes (real-time NASBA) and a colorimetric assay (NASBA ELISA 6) are used to detect NASBA products [184] [185] [186] .

Research showed that qPCR is a specific, sensitive and rapid tool to determine the presence and numbers of microorganisms in water. It has also proven to be useful for reducing the health risks associated with microorganisms in water and to assist in ensuring a safe supply of water [6, 22, 142] . The US EPA is currently considering qPCR as a rapid analytical tool to detect and quantify faecal indicators in recreational waters [118] . Limitations of using qPCR as an analytical tool in routine monitoring include the inability of qPCR to differentiate between live and dead microbial cells. The presence of PCR inhibitors in environmental water samples and the need for standardized qPCR protocols remain a challenge. There is potential for the application of high-throughput analytical systems in detection of waterborne pathogens; however, the technology is still in its infancy. Many challenges still remain to validate the methods in order to use one common protocol. Other challenges in the application of these technologies are the complexity of the assays and the time spent to train laboratory personnel. The high cost involved to do water analysis on a routine basis versus the high sensitivity and reduced time of the assays should also be considered. It is clear from the limitations described that the qPCR method still needs improvement before it can be applied for routine analysis of water.",
