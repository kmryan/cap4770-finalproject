Chlorhexidine gluconate and sodium hypochlorite were found to be surprisingly inefficient. [8] Repeated use of alcohols dries out the skin, and small quantities of the alcohols may be absorbed, but they are effective. [9] The literature on the inactivation of previously known coronaviruses by surface disinfection procedures suggested 62-71 % ethanol to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 within 1min. [10] Experimental work by several laboratories on the virus itself then showed that it is even less stable toward denaturation by alcoholic solutions. [11] Exposure to concentrations of just 30 % of either ethanol or isopropanol for 30 seconds fully suppressed viral infectivity.Likewise,the virucidal activity of the hand rub solutions known as WHO formulation 1, with 85 % ethanol, and WHO formulation 2, with 75 %i sopropanol, against SARS-CoV-2 was found to be excellent, with full inactivation of the coronavirus at 40 %or30%concentration, respectively.W hile the alcohol component is the main virucide,0 .125 % v/v H 2 O 2 is added to kill bacterial spores that may be present in the raw materials or the container.The addition of 1.45 % v/v glycerol as ah umectant improves the dermatological properties and thus the acceptance of the product.

Its structure was quickly predicted in silico and this was used for the virtual docking of ac ollection of 7173 commercial drugs in the search for candidates for drug repurposing. [28] Among the top-scoring candidates,f or which the highest binding affinities were predicted, were the two antivirals velpatasvir and ledipasvir. Both compounds are FDA-approved inhibitors of the NS5A protein of the hepatitis Cv irus,b ut so far, the predicted action against the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro has not been confirmed experimentally.A similar approach on the same enzyme was employed by another team, and led to different candidate structures, [29] while ateam from China and Saudi Arabia chose to identify phytochemicals as potential inhibitors in similar fashion using in silico methods. [30] While modeling is fast, it does not produce an ew drug, and experimental work is needed to validate those predictions.Arecent crystal structure of 3CL pro ,a lso referred to as M pro ,c omplexed with an aketoamide inhibitor shows how quickly encouraging results can be obtained experimentally. [31] Ac rystal structure of the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 has also been published in the last few days. [32] One of the most detailed theoretical studies thus far used homology modeling on 19 different SARS-CoV-proteins and on the human ACE2 receptor protein, the putative molecular entry vehicle for the virus into human cells,f or virtual drug screening. [33] Fore ach viral protein and for the ACE2 receptor,s everal drugs or natural products were identified as potential binders.N otably,r emdesivir was also found to bind to the RdRp enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 in silico.E xperimentally,activity against SARS-CoV-2 was also demonstrated in vitro. [34] In the same experimental study,a ntiviral activity was found for the antimalarial drug chloroquine, which is unlikely to act on either RdRp or proteases. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [35] act on several targets and can have severe side effects.T heir anti-inflammatory effect may reduce the level of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, mobilized by the immune system of COVID-19 patients in order to kill infected cells before too many copies of the virus are made.S ometimes this defense mechanism overreacts, resulting in al ife-threatening condition. [36] Both remdesivir and chloroquine,are currently among the compounds undergoing clinical trials with COVID-19 patients.",
