Reports from all over the world 53 are indicating that after the outbreak of COVID-19, environmental conditions including air 54 quality and water quality in rivers are improving and wildlife is blooming. India has always 55 been a hub of pollution with huge population, heavy traffics and polluting industries leading 56 to high air quality index (AQI) values in all major cities. But after declaration of lockdown 57 due to COVID-19, quality of air has started to improve and all other environmental 58 parameters such as water quality in rivers have started giving a positive sign towards 59 restoring. This paper provides evidence-based insight into improvement of air quality and 60 environment during pre and post lockdown of this pandemic situation.
