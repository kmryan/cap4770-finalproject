            "text": "Bacteria have been present on Earth for 3.5 billion years; antibiotics have been available for less than 70 years. Given their enormous biomass and rapid dividing time, bacteria have evolved nearly unlimited mechanisms of resistance against the antimicrobial armamentarium. 9,10 These include changes that exclude an antimicrobial agent from the cell (e.g., cell wall thickening in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] or porin changes in carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa), alter antimicrobial targets (e.g., changes in cell surface penicillin binding protein sites or in ribosomal protein synthesis enzymes), attack the antimicrobial agent itself (e.g., beta-lactamases that inactivate penicillins and cephalosporins), or actively push an agent out of the cell via efflux pumps. These are only a few of the numerous evasion strategies available to microorganisms. The current crisis of resistance is a result of unfettered use of antibiotics in agriculture and medicine; controlling the rise in resistance will require increased attention to appropriate use of these agents. 11 Table 32.1 lists some of the common multidrug-resistant organisms encountered in the modern ICU. Prevalence of these problem organisms has been rising steadily, providing growing challenges. [12] [13] [14] Antimicrobial resistance can come from three sourcesemergence, influx, and spread. Resistance to an agent emerges under the influence of numerous selective factors, none more influential than the antimicrobial agent itself. Once resistance has developed, it may then spread to other bacteria within the host (e.g., transfer of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL] from Klebsiella pneumoniae to neighboring Escherichia coli in the gut) or may be transported to other patients, usually via the hands of healthcare workers. Similarly, there may be an influx of undetected antimicrobial-resistant organisms into the ICU via newly admitted or transferred patients or colonized staff members. The ICU thus represents a microcosm of the evolutionary pressures favoring resistance: severe underlying illness, numerous invasive procedures, proximity to other compromised patients under emergent conditions, and frequent use of antibiotics and other defense-altering drugs.",

            "text": "Several drugs are worth noting for their abilities to engender or select for resistance. Second-and third-generation cephalosporins, because of extensive gram-negative and antistreptococcal activity, favor growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). VRE has also been associated with use of both oral and intravenous vancomycin. Numerous agents, most notably clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and possibly proton pump inhibitors, favor growth of C. difficile. Fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) and proton pump inhibitors have also been implicated in nosocomial acquisition of MRSA. 15 Resistance to carbapenems or fluoroquinolones may rapidly emerge during therapy of Pseudomonas infections. 16, 17 Researchers in New York documented a cascade of events that illustrates the roles of emergence, influx, spread, and the complexity of antimicrobial resistance. In response to an outbreak of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae infections, they curtailed use of ceftazidime, successfully reducing these infections. However, imipenem use blossomed, leading to outbreaks of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii infection. This same clone of A. baumannii, resistant to almost all drugs available, was later found in each of the 15 hospitals throughout Brooklyn, apparently transferred between hospitals along with patient and/or medical staff traffic. [18] [19] [20] Impact of Hospital-Acquired Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance Infections acquired in the hospital are among the most significant safety hazards for patients. In a study of medical injuries to patients in 7.45 million hospital discharges, Zhan et al. 21 found an excess attributable length of stay of 10.89 days, added cost of $57,727, and excess mortality of 21.96% for patients experiencing postoperative sepsis. Postoperative complications constituted the most serious injuries identified in the study. In a study at Duke, patients with surgical site infections were five times more likely to be readmitted, 60% more likely to spend time in the ICU, spent twice as long in the hospital after surgery, and had twice the mortality rate of uninfected patients. 22 In an analysis of this study and others, surgical site infection added an average of $15,646 to the cost of care. 22, 23 Similarly, antimicrobial resistance typically compounds the already significant clinical and economic impact of infection, causing increases in morbidity and mortality, length of stay, and cost. 24 Costs of antimicrobial-resistant infections are often $6,000 to $30,000 greater than with an equivalent infection caused by a susceptible strain. 24 In another systematic review, MRSA infection had an attributable cost of $35,367. 23 Antimicrobial Therapy Pharmacodynamics The effectiveness of certain antimicrobial drugs may depend on the manner of dosing. Fluoroquinolones and the aminoglycosides are concentration dependent and thus are most effective when they achieve high concentrations, surpassing the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a target organism manyfold. Once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides achieves both high concentrations of drug and very low trough levels, reducing potential toxicity. 25 In contrast, penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides (such as azithromycin), and clindamycin are most effective when they achieve levels above the MIC of the infecting organism for a prolonged period of time. Using shorter administration intervals (or in some circumstances, continuous infusions) may serve to prolong the \"time above MIC\" and enhance clinical efficacy.",

He advocated use of sharp dissection and fine sutures, gentle handling of tissues, and complete wound closure. 35 More than a century later, perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis is an adjunctive measure to these mainstays of infection prevention. Although some of the details of prophylaxis for elective surgery are altered in previously hospitalized ICU patients, the principles remain. The purpose of prophylaxis is to prevent intrinsic and extrinsic bacterial contamination of the surgical site that occurs during an operation from developing into a postoperative infection. The ideal prophylactic agent would be active against the major potential infecting agents; not induce resistance; effectively penetrate relevant tissues; have a long enough half-life to maintain effective levels throughout the procedure (re-dosing as necessary); have low toxicity and potential for allergy; have few interactions with anesthetic agents and muscle relaxants; and be cost-effective. [36] [37] [38] It should be administered within an hour before the procedure (within 2 h for vancomycin and fluoroquinolones). 39 Postoperative doses provide no added benefit. In a review of 28 studies there was no clear advantage to either multiple-or single-dose prophylaxis (odds ratio 1.06, 95% CI, 0.89-1.25). 40 Furthermore, unnecessary postoperative doses may cause harm, including allergy or anaphylaxis, prolonged bleeding times, C. difficile colitis, and selection of resistant organisms. This is particularly important in surgical ICU patients, who may require prolonged care and risk progressive acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms. 41 Similarly, \"prophylaxis\" of drains, tubes, and catheters is both ineffective and hazardous, as is an attempt to \"maintain sterility of the wound.\" 38, 42, 43 Prophylaxis for Infective Endocarditis New guidelines from the American Heart Association have drastically reduced the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis. 44 Appropriate recipients are now limited to those patients with a prior history of endocarditis, a prosthetic valve, cardiac transplantation, or with certain major congenital heart defects. Procedures in these recipients that require prophylaxis are also restricted, including procedures breaching respiratory mucosa, infected skin, or infected musculoskeletal structures. Prophylaxis solely to prevent infective endocarditis is no longer recommended for genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract procedures. Therapy Treatment of established infection in the surgical ICU relies on the principles of good medical-surgical care to minimize the infective burden and maximize host responses; antimicrobial therapy is largely an adjunct. The source of infection should be identified, as detailed previously. Foreign bodies, including prosthetic devices and catheters, frequently require removal when infected.",
