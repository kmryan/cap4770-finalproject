A prospective birth cohort study of children followed for acute respiratory infections to 2 years of age demonstrated that rhinoviruses were detected in 59% of acute respiratory infection episodes and associated with 50% of AOM episodes [7] . Rhinoviruses were also the most common viruses in both AOM-prone and non-AOM-prone children who were healthy at the time of sample collection being detected in the nasopharynx of 43% and 34% of children respectively [5] . Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al. studied the contribution of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses in children to the risk of AOM development. In this birth cohort study, the children were followed for a median of 24 months and monthly stool samples were collected and analyzed for human rhino-and enteroviruses. Of 3,438 stool samples, 10% were positive for rhinoviruses (highest prevalence age 3-6 months) and 7% for enteroviruses (highest prevalence age 12-24 months). The risk for AOM development was increased in children who were enterovirus positive at least once between 6 and 12 months of age or who were rhinovirus positive between 18 and 24 months of age [8] .",

Wagner et al. studied the role of human bocavirus in AOM to differentiate the prolonged presence of bocavirus from a newly acquired infection, and to compare new infection to AOM development. In children with URI, pyrosequencing was used to characterize bocaviruses and describe different shedding patterns; at least 46% of the children with bocavirus, shed the virus for a prolonged period repeatedly or intermittently. However, in children with newly acquired bocavirus alone, a high incidence of AOM complicating URI (53%) was noted, suggesting the ototropic nature of bocavirus. When comparing URI episodes with bocavirus co-infecting with other viruses, 43% were complicated by AOM [9] .",

However, infection with the nonreplicating adenovirus did not increase the incidence of bacterial AOM.

Nasopharyngeal swabs for viral and bacterial analyses were taken monthly at months 1-6, at 9 months, and at the time of URI or AOM. These data showed that the risk of URI was increased by the presence of any virus, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae, and the risk of AOM increased by the presence of any virus or S. pneumoniae. Interestingly, the presence of M. catarrhalis, rhinovirus/RSV, or both increased AOM risk, but the M. catarrhalis-RSV interaction decreased AOM risk compared with that of RSV alone [13] . In a further study of the same population, nasopharyngeal microbiota was compared in infants with virus-positive URI versus virus-positive and -negative healthy R.B. Thornton, et al. International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology 130 (2020) 109838 infants. This study found that in symptomatic, but not asymptomatic, URI virus infection resulted in increased abundance of Moraxella and Streptococcus in the nasopharynx. In addition, infants with more viral URIs in the first three months of age had increased abundance of Streptococcus spp., while infants with more URI in the first six months had increased abundance of Moraxella and Haemophilus genera, compared to controls. The presence of these otopathogens was specifically associated with symptomatic, but not asymptomatic, URI [14] . Microbiota changes during viral infection have also been studied during experimental human rhinovirus infection in adults. This study showed that rhinovirus infection increased the relative abundance of Haemophilus, Neisseria and Staphylococcus genera, in the upper respiratory tract [15] .",

Studies have demonstrated that non-encapsulated pneumococci can colonize and persist within the nasopharynx, and also have the capacity to persist within the middle-ear chamber in the chinchilla [16] . Of note, non-encapsulated strains utilize a diverse range of gene products for colonization and infection. Some non-encapsulated pneumococcal lineages express a surface protein, PspK, which is important in bacterial adherence to host epithelia as well as formation of biofilms and persistence in vivo. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] PspK was also shown to increase virulence in encapsulated strains as well [21] . Non-encapsulated pneumococci have also been shown to persist within polymicrobial biofilms and cause OM in conjunction with NTHi [22] . Neuraminidase (NanA) was also shown to be important in regulation of biofilm formation and in vivo disease [23] . The catalytic pathways of these sialidases were recently investigated in depth by Xiao et al. [24] Furthermore, a class of Oligopeptide Binding Proteins, AliA and AliC, can enhance mucosal infection and invasion by non-encapsulated strains [25] . Obviously, the impact of the non-encapsulated strains is potentially profound. Some have suggested that these lineages may represent escape variants selected for in the presence of widespread immunity against multiple encapsulated strains. Strategies that target these non-encapsulated strains/clades with vaccines formulated with noncapsular vaccine antigens may prove to be an effective alternative to capsular vaccines. Recent data indicate that antibodies directed against PspK and other virulence factors may have protective effects in the context of OM.",

Quorum-sensing systems play an important role in polymicrobial signaling and regulation. The LuxS/AI-2 system was found to regulate virulence and metabolism-related genes during experimental OM in the rat [28] . In addition, Cuevas et al. described a novel regulatory role for the peptide VP1, which is involved in cell-to-cell communication and regulation of biofilm formation and pathogenesis [29] . Importantly, the serotypes and lineages of pneumococci that cause coinfections with Haemophilus influenzae were shown to be distinct from those observed in other disease contexts (particularly invasive disease) and data indicate strong levels of mutualism between the different bacteria in these contexts [30, 31] . These findings are consistent with some reports that have indicated impact of pneumococcal vaccination on incidence of OM caused by S. pneumoniae [32] as well as other bacterial species [33] . Furthermore, work by Qingfu Xu et al. has shown that natural carriage of pneumococcus can be impacted by immunological deficiencies, such as those of OM-prone individuals [34] . For detailed information on the effect of pneumococcal vaccines on Streptococcal epidemiology and carriage see the Vaccines Panel report chapter in this journal edition. Overall, there is a pressing need for additional work with these non-encapsulated pneumococcal lineages to better define determinants of bacterial synergy during carriage and disease.",

Hia of the invasive clinical R2866 isolate was shown to be important for efficient killing by opsonophagocytosis and for bacterial adherence to Chang cells [48] . NTHi strains are known to encode either the Hia adhesin or the High Molecular Weight (HMW) adhesins, but never both within the same strain. A second paper by the same group identified the binding target for HMW2 as 2-6 linked N-acetylneuraminic acid and demonstrated a unique highaffinity binding specificity for each HMW adhesin. Combined data suggest that specificity for each HMW to complimentary lectins may allow NTHI to adhere to distinct niches within the human airways [49] .",

In addition, bacteria that lacked P4 were less adherent to epithelial cell lines and unable to persist as well in the mouse ear [50] . To gain better insight into the protective efficacy of surface exposed proteins (SEPs), Whitby et al. performed bioinformatic analysis of 21 sequenced NTHi genomes and identified 56 core SEPs. From these core proteins, ten highly conserved surface-exposed peptide regions were selected. Protective efficacy of antisera against these peptides were tested by passive transfer in a rat model of bacteremia. Five of the ten antisera tested provided protection from NTHi induced bacteremia. The protective antisera were directed against peptides from HxuC, ComE or Hel [51] .",

Biofilms are formed by nearly all bacterial species and provide many protective benefits, which include recalcitrance to antimicrobial treatments and innate immune effectors. Jurcisek et al demonstrated that NTHi uses remnants of a type IV secretion system and the outer membrane pore ComE, to actively release DNA and DNABII DNA-binding proteins into the extracellular milieu during biofilm formation. These components, released by a subpopulation of bacteria, provide critical structural stability to biofilms formed by NTHi [53] . Subsequent work by Devaraj et al. showed that while several other nucleoid associated proteins (NAPs) are present within biofilms formed by NTHi, the DNABII proteins IHF and HU were the only NAPs critical for biofilm structural integrity. Antibodies that target the functional portion of the DNABII proteins were able to destabilize and collapse biofilms formed by NTHi [54] . Das et al. used a mathematical modeling approach to investigate NTHi biofilm formation and confirmed the importance of extracellular DNA and the type IV pilus in biofilm structure. They showed that loss of these extracellular features significantly impacts biofilm organization. Furthermore, the model suggests that altered fractal structures within the biofilm may change the penetration of antimicrobial agents into the biofilm and affect the exchange of nutrients and cell to cell signals [55] .",

AI-2 was shown to upregulate expression of a probable glycosyltransferase that was also required for biofilm persistence within the chinchilla middle ear [56] . Microenvironmental growth conditions have also been shown to impact NTHi biofilm formation, in vitro. Mokrzan et al. found that the type IV pilus (Tfp) is upregulated during biofilm formation at the temperature of the human nasopharynx, 34\u00b0C, compared to that of the middle ear, 37\u00b0C.

These findings highlight the importance of heme acquisition during disease within the middle ear [58] . The source of heme is also an important point to consider. In addition to soluble heme, NTHI are able to extract heme from heme-binding proteins in the extracellular environment. Work by Sgheiza et al. found that while NTHi are able to extract and use heme that is non-covalently bound to proteins, NTHI are unable to efficiently acquire heme that has been covalently bound to protein [59] .",

Phasevarions have since been identified in several human mucosal-associated bacteria. A total of 21 different phasevarion types were identified across a diverse set of clinical NTHi isolates, and the phasevarion mechanism was shown to regulate multiple virulence phenotypes and several surface proteins that are also potential vaccine targets [60] . Brockman et al. subsequently found that the phasevarion impacted disease progression and severity in a chinchilla model of NTHi-induced experimental OM. A shift in the phasevarion status, or an epigenetic switch, significantly increased disease severity compared to a genetically identical population that did not shift phasevarion status [61] . The phasevarion was also shown to regulate NTHi biofilm formation under various disease specific conditions.

They found that NTHi that had undergone transient heme-iron restriction formed significantly more intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) within human airway epithelial cells compared to NTHi that were never heme-iron restricted. Transiently restricted bacteria altered trafficking within human airway epithelial cells and promoted IBC formation in a process that required macropinocytosis [63] . In a second paper by this group, transient heme-iron restriction was shown to cause a naturally occurring mutation in the icc gene, which resulted in decreased cAMP phosphodiesterase activity. This mutation resulted in decreased bacteria within the middle ear fluids compared to wildtype un-restricted bacteria. Instead loss of icc lead to increased formation of intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). These IBCs populations may serve as dormant reservoirs of bacteria that later serve as a source for recurrent infections [64] .",

Importantly, the M. catarrhalis-bound plasminogen could still be activated by urokinase plasminogen activator into plasmin that is proteolytically active. Such an interaction might enable M. catarrhalis to acquire exogenous protease as a virulence mechanism to compensate the lack of any endogenous virulent protease in this species.

Host nitrite promotes bacterial growth and biofilm formation in the early hours of infection, whereas nitrite reduction-derived NO\u02d9is toxic towards M. catarrhalis in maturing biofilms. The work suggested that nitrite reduction-derived NO \u2212 might act by dual mechanisms, both by promoting M. catarrhalis infection and spontaneously resolving bacterial biofilm formation. In another study, Tan and collaborators defined the role of membrane-associated NucM of M. catarrhalis, an entry nuclease that degrades extracellular DNA and RNA, in bacterial biofilm scaffolding and competence [73] . A mutant devoid of NucM was associated with increased biofilm mass. Moreover, decreased expression of NucM in chemically defined medium may correlate with early infection resulting in aggregation and biofilm formation in the host. At later stages of colonization, enhanced NucM concentrations may ultimately trigger the dispersal of M. catarrhalis to other sites for spread of infection.

            "text": "Using a genomic mining approach, Murphy and collaborators have extensively mapped a series of ABC transporters [74] with some of them proposed as potential vaccine antigens against M. catarrhalis. This includes several substrate binding proteins (SBPs) that have been defined and carefully assessed in downstream analyses. The various identified SBPs (ABC transporters) are indeed linked to M. catarrhalis pathogenesis. Importantly, they are involved in bacterial stress responses upon exposure to the harsh environment in the host, bacterial invasion of the respiratory epithelial cells, and persistence of infection in the lungs. The detailed virulence role of Moraxella substrate binding protein (SBP) type 1, 2 and 3 have been thoroughly investigated by Otsuka and collaborators [75] . SBP1 and 3 have an importance for M. catarrhalis invasion of human respiratory epithelial cells with a nutritional role in intracellular survival, whereas SBP2 is responsible for arginine uptake. In particular, SBP2 and its important function makes this protein an attractive target and vaccine candidate. Of note, the oligopeptide permease (Opp) ABC transporter system is a nutritional virulence factor important for Moraxella-dependent acquisition of peptides [76] . Five opp genes are located in the same operon and are regulated by temperature (cold shock; 26\u00b0C) and nutrient supply. In a separate study, OppA that is found to be surface exposed during infection carries three immunogenic epitopes that are shown to be protective in a mouse pulmonary clearance model [77] .",

However, in other areas H. influenzae and pneumococci are equally common [67, 86] or H. influenzae is predominant [87] . With the introduction of the PCV vaccines, H. influenzae has emerged as the main otopathogen associated with AOM in many studies [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] and this change of microflora has also resulted in an increased detection of S. aureus and S. pyogenes in these children [87, 93] . Although pneumococcal detection during AOM has decreased, two observations need to be taken into account. First, the non-encapsulated strains, expressing pneumococcal surface proteins, such as PspK, have increased in prevalence due to the decrease in pneumococcal vaccine types [18, 25] . Second, although pneumococci have decreased as the main cause of AOM, the long-term effects of the PCV vaccines are unknown. With the introduction of PCV7, a substantial decrease in OM was observed that was reversed over the next couple of years due to serotype replacement. This led to the development of PCV10 and PCV13 that have recently been introduced in general immunization programs around the world and resulted in a new decrease in pneumococcal detection. Whether this decrease will be stable or reversed in the future remains to be seen.",

This is partly due to the increased use of PCR techniques over culture for detection that has led to this slow-growing organism being detected at significantly higher levels [95, 97] . It is particularly prevalent in samples from patients with OME, where it can be detected in 55-80% of MEF samples [89, 95] , but is also detected in some patients with AOM [88, 89, 98] . A. otitidis was previously found to cause OM in a rat model and has more recently been shown to form single and polymicrobial biofilms with other otopathogens [97] .

In individuals with tympanic membrane perforations, S. pneumoniae was often identified either alone or in combination with H. influenzae [86] and in a separate study, H. influenzae was commonly detected alone in MEE after perforation and was the most common pathogen seen in co-infections [113] .

In these studies, P. aeruginosa was a common cause of otorrhea [117] and this otopathogen is often involved in chronic, long-term infections that are hard to treat [118] . The general role of S. aureus in severe OM and AM infections is less clear although it was identified in most studies included in this review.

H. influenzae often co-exists with other otopathogens, such as S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and A. otitidis [86, 88, 97, 120] , and these organisms are often found together in polymicrobial biofilms [119, 121] . Otopathogens combining into dual or multispecies biofilms are often at an advantage due to interspecies signaling and the ability of one organism to protect the other from antimicrobial factors [122, 123] . These mechanisms of persistence and disease chronicity are important to understand both from the perspective of disease pathogenesis and to develop treatments and preventative strategies.",

Because of its fundamental similarity (>95%) to humans at the genetic level, knock out mice present a unique opportunity to gain valuable insight into the genetic basis and pathobiology of OM. Additionally, the mouse has an associated vast array of widely available reagents, such as antibodies, for study of the host and its immune response. Correspondingly the mouse is used for study of expression and function of a wide variety of immune molecules and cells that have a relevance to the onset, progression and resolution of OM and AOM. Mutant mouse lines have continued to prove useful for the study of the function of host genes such as ccl3 [138] , IL-17A [139] , tlr 2 [140] . Novel mouse lines that spontaneously attain chronic OM characteristics have also been characterized for mutations in the genes Enpp1 [141] , nischarin [142] and the tbx1 gene linked to DiGeorge syndrome [143] . Long lasting OM is also effectively achieved through surgical obstruction of the Eustachian tube [144] .",

In a study conducted by Hua et al., they demonstrated IgG to both P6 and PD was lowest in children under 1 month of age, increased from 6 months, peaking at 7 months to 3 years and remaining high until 6 years of age before declining. Interestingly, antibody titres were the lowest in the 21-30 year age group [166] . This study also identified one PD and two P6 T cell epitopes that were better recognized in human serum and which they suggest may contribute to the development of a strain independent vaccine [166] . When assessing the opsonising ability of naturally acquired HMW1 and HMW2 serum antibodies from both adults and children, a study by Winter and Barenkamp demonstrated that these are able to effectively mediate opsonophagocytic killing of NTHi [52] . In a study assessing population immune differences, compared to healthy controls, Australian Aboriginal children undergoing surgery for OM had lower serum IgG to all proteins measured but this was particularly apparent for PD. These reduced IgG titres to PD were also seen in non-Aboriginal children undergoing surgery for OM but this deficit was not as pronounced [167] . Interestingly, this deficiency was not seen in mucosal antibody titres for any of the proteins where Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children had equal or higher antibody titres when compared to healthy controls [167] .",

[176] FMOD, OSAD, and BGN were shown to competitively inhibit binding of C4b-binding protein to the surface of M. catarrhalis (a conserved immune evasion strategy), resulting in increased C3b/iC3b deposition, membrane attack complex (MAC) formation, and subsequently decreased bacterial survival [176] . Furthermore, both OSAD and BGN promote enhanced neutrophil killing in vitro, both in a complement-dependent and independent fashion [176] .

The first by Pickering et al., shows that the in vitro pre-treatment of epithelial cells with the commensal Haemophilus haemolyticus, a closely related species to NTHi, reduces the attachment and invasion of the otopathogen species, though the mechanism by which this happens is unknown [179] . Another in vitro study by van den Broek et al., showed that the lactobacillus species L. rhamnosus is able to decrease M. catarrhalis adhesion to human airway epithelial cells (CALU-3), resulting in decreased expression of MUC5AC, IL-8, IL-1B and TNF-\u03b1 by at least 1.2 fold [180] .

Using a mouse model of S. pneumoniae OM, Huang et al. have shown that TLR2 signalling is critical for bacterial clearance and timely resolution of inflammation in pneumococcal OM [140] . By assessment of the pathogenesis of both encapsulated and non-encapsulated strains of the pneumococcus, Keller et al. have demonstrated that pneumococcal surface protein K (PspK) and pneumolysin (Ply) affect NESp middle ear pathogenesis, but only PspK affected epithelial cell adhesion [18] .

They demonstrated that human apolactoferrin (ALF) and lysozyme (LZ) have a synergistic killing effect on the pneumococcus [182] . Interestingly they also demonstrated that pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), an important vaccine candidate, partially protects pneumococci from ALF mediated killing, while antibodies against this PspA enhance killing of the homologous strain by ALF [182] .

However, a study by Liu et al., has shown that the ubiquitous surface protein A (UspA) of M. catarrhalis directly interacts with the cartilage oligomeric matrix (COMP), a major structural component of cartilage and regulator of complement activity, an observation not seen for any other otopathogens [183] . Binding COMP was directly correlated with survival of M. catarrhalis in human serum by inhibiting bactericidal activity of the complement membrane attack complex and inhibiting phagocytic killing by neutrophils [183] . COMP also reduced bacterial adhesion and uptake by human lung epithelial cells, thus protecting M. catarrhalis from intracellular killing by epithelial cells [183] . Together these data suggest that strategies for inhibiting this interaction, perhaps through a vaccine that targets UspA, may represent a new strategy to prevent infection with M. catarrhalis and warrants further investigation.",

Several studies have been published over the past four years that demonstrate differences in population genetics and different susceptibility profiles. Several small studies have been conducted and indicate that differences exist between children who experience chronic or recurrent OM. A study by Larson et al. has described novel variants of A2ML1 which are independently associated with OM, particularly in the indigenous Filipino population who also demonstrate lower A2ML1 expression [186] . These findings were indicated to support a role for A2ML1 in keratinocyte differentiation within the middle ear as part of OM pathology and the authors propose a potential application of ROCK inhibition in otitis media [186] . Another study by Toivenean et al., have demonstrated that genetic polymorphisms in mannose binding lectins and TLRs promote susceptibility to or protection against respiratory infections, and suggest these require further study [187] . Polymorphisms in FBX011 and TGIF1 have been further supported to play a role in OM by Bhutta et al. [188] Both FBX011 and TGIF1 are involved in TGF-\u03b2 signalling, suggesting this pathway may be important in the transition from acute to chronic middle ear inflammation, and indicate these may be a potential molecular target [188] . Another genotype related to the immune response that may be genetically related, but not independently associated with OM is shown by a study from Miljanovic et al. who indicated that highproducing IL10 -1082 GA/GG genotypes may increase the risk for OM proneness in its carriers when exposed to other environmental/host risk factors [189] .",

Another study has indicated that IFN\u03b3 rs12369470CT was significantly less common in children with rAOM than in healthy controls [191] . The IL-10 rs1800896TC SNP and the IL-1\u03b1 rs6746923A and AG SNPs were significantly more and less common, respectively, among children without a history of tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) than among those who suffered from this complication [191] .

            "text": "Recently, ample evidence in host immunity and responses have emerged, defining the role of mucin glycoproteins in disease progression and susceptibility. Mucins are heavily glycosylated proteins which comprise airway mucous, and although they play an important immunologic role at mucosal surfaces by providing a physical and biological barrier against pathogens, persistence of airway mucous becomes pathologic. Previous work has shown mucin MUC5B to be the predominant mucin glycoprotein in COM effusions [192] . MUC5B is composed of a protein backbone decorated with nitrogen linked carbohydrates (N-glycans) whereas the central protein is composed of proline, threonine and serine regions decorated with oxygen linked glycans (O-glycans) separated by cysteine rich regions. A recent study of Muc5b null mice demonstrated a critical role for Muc5b in middle ear and upper airway immune defense [193] . Indeed, Muc5b KO mice show highly penetrant susceptibility to spontaneous middle ear infection. As it is becoming increasingly clear that the glycosylation pattern of mucins influences their immune function, it is noteworthy that glycans impact mucin differential targeting of immune effector cells and are key regulators in mucosal diseases [194] . Glycans are sugar molecules, such as sialic acids and fucose, that are attached to glycoproteins and are recognized by specific glycan-binding proteins leading to a variety of functions, such as proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cellular responses [195] . The two main families of sialic acid binding receptors on leukocytes are the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) and Selectin receptors that have been proved to impact eosinophilic inflammation and neutrophil activation including NET formation [196] [197] [198] . Notably, mice deficient in \u03b12,3 sialyltransferase (St3Gal3) and hence unable to link terminal sialic acid residues to glycoproteins show enhanced eosinophilic airway inflammation [196] . Specific to COM progression, fucosylated glycans have been implicated in OM -as variants of the fucose transferase FUT2 gene were found to be associated with OM predisposition. Notably, OM bacterial pathogens were shown to activate FUT2 [199] . Taken together, these recent studies, suggest that middle ear mucins, rich in glycans such as fucose and sialic acids, predictably interact with neutrophils and other innate immune cells in the middle ear, driving their function. Ultimately, an inadequate balance of glycosylation function may underpin OM disease susceptibility and progression.",

The main themes that arose were 1) that animal models are an essential part of testing for novel regimens to treat or prevent disease, 2) prevention of viral infections at early age could prevent early colonization of otopathogens, 3) pathogenesis may be different in each population meaning any treatment may not be a one-size fits all and this needs to be considered when studying disease pathogenesis, 4) the emergence of novel bacterial and fungal species warrants increased monitoring of their incidence in future studies of otitis media and 5) the increased incidence of these species, some of which are increasingly drug-resistant, has implications for both clinical diagnostics and therapy.",
