Based on the specific serotype regions I, II, and III, a multiplex PCR protocol (mPCR) was designed to differentiate the main serotypes causing fish diseases. A real-time PCR method (qPCR) is also described to identify S. parauberis of serotype III in bacterial cultures and fish tissues. In silico and in vitro analyses revealed that both methods have a 100% specificity. The mPCR assay was optimized for the detection of S. parauberis strains of subtypes Ia (amplicon size 213 bp), subtypes Ib and Ic (both amplicon size 303 bp), serotype II (amplicon size 403 bp), and serotype III (amplicon size 130 bp) from bacterial cultures. The qPCR assay was optimized for the identification and quantification of S. parauberis serotype III strains in bacterial cultures and fish tissues. This assay achieved a sensitivity of 2.67 \u00d7 10 2 gene copies (equivalent to 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ng/\u03bcl) using pure bacterial cultures of S. parauberis serotype III and 1.76 \u00d7 10 2 gene copies in fish tissues experimentally and naturally infected with S. parauberis of the serotype III.

Serotype-specific regions were used to optimize a mPCR protocol capable of differentiating the main S. parauberis serotypes causing disease in fish (serotypes I, II, and III). In addition, a qPCR assay to identify and quantify strains of S. parauberis belonging to serotype III from bacterial cultures and fish tissues has been optimized. These PCR protocols could be useful tool in epidemiological surveillance studies or for diagnostic purposes using bacterial culture and lethal and non-lethal fish tissues as samples. The PCR methods described are inexpensive with low risk of contamination that can be implemented as a tool for diagnosis and typing in clinical laboratories, thus avoiding the disadvantages of conventional serological methods.
