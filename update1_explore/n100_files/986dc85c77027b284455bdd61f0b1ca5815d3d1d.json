Although Africa's youth may be considered a significant protective factor in the pandemic, how the virus will evolve and manifest itself on the continent remains unknown. Africa's greater youthfulness may act to its advantage in terms of lower death rates. However, African countries must not expect a mild version of the disease or lower infection rates. Rather, planning must be centered on containing the spread of the virus as one way of cushioning the fragile health systems and reducing the overall impact of the virus. Capitalizing on the youthfulness of the African population should be through leveraging predictive modeling to develop Africa-specific responses both medically and economically. Responding to the virus through economic policies is equally important as it affects the people's everyday way of life, and long after the virus is gone, the economic effects are likely to persist.",

The current standard of care for COVID-19 is supportive care as there are no specific treatments yet. This means antipyretics, hydration, and ventilatory support if a patient develops respiratory distress. The shortage of ventilators has already been experienced by most of the African countries who are extremely affected by this pandemic. One of the main reasons for the shortage of ventilators is the issues related to their global supply chain 28 . Due to the worldwide spread of infection, the exports of medical equipment including ventilators has been interrupted. As of 24 March 2020, 54 countries had stopped exporting ventilators 29 .

This is an alarming statistic. The vulnerability of one single country can have far-reaching ramifications to tens of countries, especially the neighboring ones. Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is the continent's equivalent to the US CDC. Africa CDC is part of the African Union. The response of Africa CDC has been instrumental in Africa's COVID-19 response. The public health institute has led diagnostic testing training for health workers and public information management for government officials. On 13 th February, before the confirmation of any case in Africa, the center established the Africa Task Force for Novel Coronavirus. The taskforce works to coordinate preparedness and response to the virus. The depleted state of health systems that are conflict-affected undermines outbreak response efforts. Damaged infrastructure, depleted workforce, and limited funding are all impediments to effective emergency response activities. In North Africa, Libya has been engulfed in war and conflict for nearly a decade since the ousting of its long-term ruler Muammar Gaddafi. Libya's health system may be one of the least well prepared on the continent to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. In South Sudan, decades of conflict have weakened the health infrastructure and other social amenities. Relief efforts are difficult to coordinate due to some humanitarian challenges that include massive population movement and ongoing conflicts 37 . Humanitarian efforts to mitigate health challenges and food shortages are being hampered by bureaucratic harassment of relief organizations.

The ongoing humanitarian crisis will greatly reduce the capacity to coordinate efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic in the affected countries. Health systems in some parts of Africa have been strained in the past few decades due to the high prevalence of HIV and TB. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for more than 70% of the global burden of HIV infection 39 . In recent years, Africa has experienced infectious disease outbreaks. In 2018, a total of 96 new infectious disease outbreaks were reported across 36 of the 47 member states of the World Health Organization Africa region 40 . The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) had a prolonged Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that hit West Africa between 2013 and 2016, aggravated by weaknesses in the health system. Similar challenges have precipitated the 2018 EVD outbreak in the DRC, which is ongoing",

These capabilities need to be harnessed and strengthened and spread across all African states to enhance the response against COVID-19. There was considerable infrastructure investment as most affected countries received support from nongovernmental organizations and Africa CDC. In Sierra Leone, for instance, the national committees set up for the Ebola response have been resurrected to spearhead the COVID-19 response, and the local population unlike in other countries not affected by EVD are arguably more used to public health measures and quarantines 45 . Officials of the Ministry of Health and Sanitation have been canvassing the country preaching the same message of \"less touching\", which they spread during the EVD outbreak. Existing health infrastructure and programs used for previous outbreaks can be leveraged in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In Nigeria, local preparedness was enhanced by the availability of resources meant for fighting the wild poliovirus. The polio infrastructure includes laboratory services, surveillance, risk communication, and human resources.",

It is time for the leadership of African countries to take a more proactive role in learning from the successes and failures of the world's worst affected countries and shape their response to capitalize on the learned successes. This way, minimizing the spread of the virus is not a farfetched idea. The African Union Commission, Africa CDC, and the WHO, in partnership with African countries, have established the Africa Taskforce for Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (AFTCOR). The partnership has six work streams: laboratory diagnosis and subtyping; surveillance, including screening at points of entry and cross-border activities; infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities; clinical management of people with severe COVID-19; risk communication; and supply-chain management and stockpiles.

To prevent the limited health facilities from collapsing, the first critical step will have to be preventing infection among the health workers, the failure of which could have grave consequences. The number of confirmed cases in Africa remains mainly among the returning citizens and foreign nationals. Vulnerable communities such as people living in densely populated informal settlements remain largely unaffected by the virus. Most urban centers are densely populated, and the generational house sharing may make social distancing impossible. Kenya is home to one of the largest refugee camps. Dadaab camp is overcrowded and devoid of basic amenities such as water, food, and sanitation, but there is still no reported confirmed case of COVID-19 among these vulnerable groups at the time of writing this paper. It is now time for African governments to focus their efforts and resources towards preventing the spread of the virus to these high-risk communities.Containment measures must be extended beyond policy and healthcare. Governments must appeal to the people's goodwill, understanding, and cooperation. The only way to achieve this is through social awareness and effective communication to fight widespread misinformation and overcome resistance. People are generally likely to be resistant to that which they do not understand. It is upon the government to implore on the people that the measures are for their best interests. The people must also be made to fully understand how the virus is spread and what to do in case one becomes symptomatic.
