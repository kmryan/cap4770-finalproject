The CDC recommends that aerosol generating procedures performed on known or suspected COVID-19 patients should be in negative pressure/ airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) [8] . However, an important additional clinical concern is how to deliver aerosol generating procedures to patients who are infected, but asymptomatic. The onset for COVID-19 infection is up to 14 days and about 80% of patients may be either asymptomatic or have symptoms reminiscent of mild flu or seasonal allergies [9] . Moreover, the growing recognition of nosocomial transmission via aerosol generation has prompted a re-examination of aerosol production in the dental operatory [10] .",

Using a Milwaukee Hole Dozer Bi-Metal Hole Saw (Milwaukee Tool, Brookfield, WI), a 2.5\" hole was drilled through the polycarbonate to allow the DOM objective lens to hold the polycarbonate to the microscope body(Fig 2A, B). A 4-1/8\" hole was drilled just posterior to the LED light housing to permit attachment of the exhaust hose(Fig 1C, 1D, 2B). Four additional 1/8 inch holes were drilled to attach the 4\" inlet flange to the polycarbonate shield (Fig 1C, Part 70126, Powertec Inc, Waukegan, IL)).
