            "text": "Introduction 48 Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 2.5 million cases have been 49 diagnosed worldwide (1) . These diagnoses were made using material collected from NP swabs, 50 which provide the highest sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection during early infection 51 using commercial RT-PCR-based assays. An NP swab is an FDA Class I exempt medical 52 device roughly 15 cm in length and 2-3mm in diameter designed to collect secretions from the 53 posterior nasopharynx (Figs. 1a, left and 1b, top) . The head of the swab is generally coated with 54 short synthetic filaments called flock. The swab is inserted into the nasopharynx, rotated several 55 times to collect material, and then placed into a vial containing a few milliliters of transport 56 media. A breakpoint on the shaft enables detachment and release of the head into the vial, 57 which is then sealed and sent for testing. 58 The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in severe shortages of NP swabs, due to both 59 manufacturing stoppages resulting in decreased supply and the spread of the pandemic 60 resulting in unprecedented demand (2). To address the swab shortage, hospitals and other 61 testing centers have repurposed other commercially available swabs (e.g. throat, urogenital) to 62 collect nasal epithelial mucosa for testing (Fig. 1a , second from left and 1b, second from top). 63 However, such swabs are suboptimal for swabbing the nasopharynx due to differences in size 64 and flexibility and the possibility they contain PCR-inhibitory materials (3, 4). Material from other 65 sites has not yet been shown to be able to substitute for swabbing the nasopharynx. 66 One solution to the swab crisis is to design and 3D-print swabs. Advantages of 3D printing 67 include simplicity (avoiding the multistep process of applying flock), the widespread availability 68 of 3D printing capacity, and the ability to iterate prototypes rapidly (5). To resolve the swab-69 shortage crisis, we have been coordinating an open collaborative process that has brought 70 together many medical centers, individuals, academic laboratories, and both new and well 71 established manufacturers (6). As part of this process, we have been testing and continuously 72 providing feedback on prototype swabs in order to proceed rapidly but safely toward the 73 development of swabs that can be used clinically, at volumes equal to the need. The openness 74 of the process was a conscious decision supported by a substantial body of scientific literature, 75 including the previous experience of the present authors, that demonstrates the advantages of 76 openness over closed or hybrid approaches (7-9). At our institution, this process has led to an 77 ongoing clinical trial of several prototype swabs, the first results of which we report here.",

By tapping our personal and professional 83 networks, we nucleated an ad hoc network of manufacturers that included companies, 84 academic groups, and individuals. This grew to include other medical centers interested in 85 helping develop and test new swabs. These other groups were given the ability to add to the 86 repository as desired. 87 We devised a three-phase process consisting of preclinical evaluation (Phase I), production 88 considerations (Phase II), and field testing (Phase III). We described these processes on the 89 repository for all to see. We took high-resolution photographs of all prototypes and stored Phase 90 I results in a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) spreadsheet that 91 remains publicly available in the repository.

We collected and tested control and prototype swab pairs from To better assess possible performance differences between control and prototype swabs, we 224 compared Ct values for control-prototype pairs for which at least one was positive (assigning the 225 maximum-possible Ct to negatives; see Methods). Specifically, we asked whether the Ct values 226 for the prototype swabs were systematically different from those of the control swabs. 227 Systematically higher values for prototype swabs would suggest that they may underperform 228 control swabs, notwithstanding the high kappa values. A p-value of >0.05 indicates no statistical 229 difference. Although there were more datapoints below the 1:1 line than above it (Fig. 2b) , 230 statistical testing revealed no evidence for underperformance, with MWU p-values of 0.36, 0.26, 231 0.42, and 0.31 for Prototypes 1-4, respectively (Fig. 2b) .

It remains to be seen how complementary manufacturing techniques, each with 266 advantages and disadvantages relative to 3D printing, will contribute in a more mature market 267 and less urgent setting. Second, in any cooperative process there is a temptation to \"defect,\" i.e. 268 taking without giving back. Individuals and manufacturers may well exploit open knowledge for 269 competitive advantage (16). This is a known price of openness that can disincentivize 270 cooperation, absent social or structural mechanisms to enforce norms; managing this 271 temptation took considerable effort by all. Third, ideally the study size would have been larger, 272 and there would have been a better null model than replicates separated by many hours, to 273 which to compare our results. Possible sources of variance in our study include differences in 274 secretions or viral burden between nares and the possibility that the first (control) swab left less 275 material for the second (prototype) when the same naris was used for both swabs. Despite 276 these potential issues, our statistical tests supported analytical non-inferiority for all four 277 prototypes. And fourth, we note our \"round-robin\" A-B testing survey was useful in summarize 278 preferences, although the narrative comments seemed often to be more positive than the round 279 robin suggested. A possible explanation is that the control swab was preferred in large part 280 simply due to its being familiar, and preferred only narrowly (if often). 281 Like the control swab, the prototype swabs we tested can be improved upon, and manufacturers 282 are currently doing so. The same is true for other prototypes we may test through our ongoing 283 clinical trial. Especially in a crisis, perfect is the enemy of good enough. The pandemic 284 continues to change quickly, and bottlenecks will likely continue to appear unpredictably. The 285 constant requirement is the ability to respond in a timely fashion under this extraordinary 286 pressure.

To date we have evaluated 48 materials and 160 designs submitted to us for 182 testing by 4 individuals, 2 laboratories, and 18 companies, for a total of 24 manufacturers. 183 Seven (4.4%) have passed Phase I testing. Most failures were either for inappropriate materials, 184 including some that were sticky or brittle, or for inappropriate designs, including those with sharp 185 heads. Prototypes from 19 manufacturers went through at least two iterations, with a maximum 186 of 28 prototypes from one manufacturer (Prototype 4 below; Fig. 1). The rate-limiting steps were 187 receipt of new prototypes, with slow mail delivery during the pandemic being a major 188 contributor, and PCR-compatibility testing, as testing patient samples took priority over testing 189 prototypes.

Because testing runs were batched and the COVID-19 status of participants was 206 not known prior to testing, the number of control-positives usually exceeded the minimum 207 requirement of 10 (range, 10-19). Total collection time was 2-3 days per prototype. The 208 frequency of control-positive tests was 18%, generally increasing by prototype as the pandemic 209 worsened in and around Boston. 210 Comparison. All four prototypes exhibited a high degree of concordance with the control swab, 211 with kappas of 0.88, 0.85, 0.89, and 0.88, respectively (Fig. 2a). For convenience we use the 212 terminology of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, with the 213 control swab result considered the provisional gold standard. Prototypes exhibited 0-1 false 214 positives and 1-2 false negatives. However, since control swabs are known to be an imperfect 215 gold standard (<100% sensitivity) and because PCR positives are more likely to reflect true 216 infection than error, false positives were interpreted as identifying missed infections; indeed, 217 false positives were referred to clinical care teams as clinically actionable, as per IRB protocol. 218 Of note, discordant cases were always associated with high Ct values, reflecting low viral load 219 (Fig. 2b). For example, for Prototype 4, the control swab for one of the two false negatives had a 220 Ct of 31.47, just shy of 31.50, our hospital's cutoff for reportability (corresponding approximately 221 to a single virion per mL of VTM); in addition, testing of this false negative was delayed by 16 222 hours because of prioritizing patient samples, which can result in decreased signal.223",

Details can be found on the GitHub repository in the 250 updates at https://github.com/rarnaout/Covidswab/tree/master/BIDMC. 251 Discussion 252 The COVID-19 pandemic has forced healthcare providers to seek alternative sources of critical 253 materials affected by supply-chain disruptions and increases in demand. The situation has 254 forced providers to innovate under extraordinary time-pressure. Over the course of our study we 255 received numerous anecdotal reports of swab shortages at hospitals across the United States 256 and in Europe, necessitating urgent stopgap solutions. Scientific literature on time-sensitive 257 innovation suggests that open, collaborative, decentralized processes outperform closed or 258 proprietary ones (7-9). Here we report the success of such a process, going from the 259 identification of the swab crisis to multiple clinically validated prototypes capable of high-volume 260 manufacture beginning at 22 days. Notably, none of the prototypes tested were flocked, yet their 261 performance was statistically indistinguishable from the flocked control swab. 262 The urgency of the situation, the configuration of the manufacturing ecosystem, and human 263 nature contributed to several observations and shortcomings worth mentioning.
