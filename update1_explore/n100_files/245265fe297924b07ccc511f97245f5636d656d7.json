This situation was perceived as highly stressful and the patient started presenting with anxiety and insomnia and therefore lorazepam 2 mg/day had been started. Two days before psychiatric admission, the patient started referring to her family delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation (\"we are all going to die and there are not going to be ICU for me or my family\"), presenting suspiciousness and delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement.",

It should be noted that around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term (Kingston et al., 2013) . This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic. However, mental health-centered support in such extraordinary settings is often poorly coordinated, with controversies on the best approach to use . Addressing the priority of mental health in the general population as well as in healthcare professionals is essential in addition to the infection medical care. Trained staff should identify healthcare professionals atrisk to develop psychiatric symptomatology and refer them to specialists for intervention (Pfefferbaum and North, 2020) and working teams should be reinforced providing regular contact to discuss decisions and, once the crisis begins to recede, active monitoring, support, and, if necessary, evidence-based treatments should be provided (Greenberg et al., 2020) .",

These populations should not be overlooked, and mental health home hospitalization care has been proposed as an alternative to address this problem (Garriga et al., 2020) . Additionally, not only healthcare workers, but also other types of workers who are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection through their work, usually from being in close proximity to members of the public, should not be disregarded as they may share some of the stressors leading to severe mental illness and potential psychiatric repercussions as in the exposed case (Sim, 2020) . There is an urgent need to monitor mental health and the ongoing onset and persistence of psychiatric symptoms in different populations, to understand the unmet needs and allocate resources for suitable and specific interventions.",
