The first case was identified in the north of Italy on February 21 st , and on the same date, the Government issued the fist law decree to impose quarantine in small selected towns. On February 25 th , the Government extended the restrictions to impose remote working for all public offices, shutting down schools, and classes at Universities. Restrictions applied to the largest four regions in the north of Italy. On March 1 st , these restrictions were extended to the whole Italy, with further lockdown actions entering in place on March 4 th and 8 th . On March 11 th , the \"#IoRestoACasa\" Prime Ministerial Decree imposed a total lockdown to the whole Italy. Since then, and still at the time of writing, people are allowed to exit from home only for specific and urgent needs. Common retail businesses, catering and restaurant services are suspended. Gatherings in public places are prohibited. All activities not deemed essential for the Italian production chain are closed. Italy entered the most restrictive lockdown in its history. Figure 1 clearly depicts the impact of these measures. 1 It shows the variation of the mobility patterns in Italy since the begin of the emergency and the impact of the restrictions and total lockdown. The vertical bars highlight the relevant events listed above. The leftmost violet bar identifies the date of the first COVID-19 case in Italy. The central brown bar identifies the school shutdown. The rightmost bar marks the date of the \"#IoRestoACasa\" decree. The decrease in mobility is drastic after each of those events.",

PoliTO opted to implement an inhouse e-learning solution based on the BigBlueButton framework to support all the classes of the second semester, which were scheduled to start on March 2 nd . 2 The platform has been designed, installed, and tested during the first week of March, going live for the starting of the online semester one week later. Here we leverage this unique point of view to observe changes in the campus traffic and services during such a singular event. Moreover, we dig into details on how students access online classes and teaching material. Since students enjoy classes from their homes at different places, connected by different network operators, we check whether and how these factors affect the performance of the online teaching systems.",

In our analysis, we consider PoliTO campus and compare it with two other large Italian universities for reference, namely Politecnico di Milano (the biggest technical university in Italy) and Universit di Torino. 5 While GARR offers only high-level aggregated data, here we also leverage on fine-grained measurements exposed by the monitoring infrastructure deployed in the Campus network. Such infrastructure is based on Tstat [3] , a passive sniffer that analyzes the traffic entering and leaving the Campus. It computes flow-level logs similar to NetFlow, exposing information about TCP and UDP flows observed in the network. Beside classical flow-level fields, such as IP addresses and port numbers, Tstat exposes metrics such as Round-Trip time (RTT) and packet losses. We store Tstat logs in a secured Hadoop-based cluster. Tstat limits as much as possible any information that can be used to identify users -e.g., client IP addresses are anonymized using the CryptoPan algorithm [4] , and no payload is stored. All data collection is approved and supervised by the responsible University officers.",

The BigBlueButton client-side application is based on HTML5. It provides high-quality audio, video and screen sharing application using the browsers built-in support for web real-time communication (WebRTC) libraries. In a nutshell, once the virtual classroom has been set up, BigBlue-Button servers act as WebRTC Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) capable of receiving multiple media streams (video, audio, screen sharing, etc.) and deciding which of these media streams should be sent to which participants. Video is encoded using the high-quality open-source codec VP8. PoliTO's setup lets the lecturer choose four video quality levels with a bitrate of 50, 100 (the default), 200, 300 kbit/s. Screen sharing may require the highest share of bandwidth, and, if the presenters screen is updating frequently, the Big-BlueButton client could transmit up to 1.0 Mbit/s. Audio is encoded using the OPUS encoder at 40 kb/s. 6 Finally, sharing slides takes little bandwidth beyond the initial upload/download of the pdf file.",

This difference reflects the different lockdown policies imposed by each university. PoliTO and UniTO completely blocked all teaching and research activities, while PoliMI still allows the activity of some laboratories. The negative y\u2212axes report the outgoing traffic. Again, the three campuses present different behaviors: We see a major increase in outgoing traffic from PoliTO, which is not observed in other campuses. This behavior is justified by the online teaching platform hosted in PoliTO which causes an increase of about 2.8 times the baseline outgoing traffic during peak time.

In Teams' jargon, both calls and meetings are online video conferencing; calls have two participants. 9 Each point in Figure 4 marks the number of people using each functionality at least once in a day. Teams was already available but only marginally used in the campus before the lockdown, with few tens of users per day. As for other services supporting smart working, its usage explodes during March. Compared to smart working connectivity solutions -see Figure 3 -the growth is slightly less abrupt, showing that the people resorted first to means to access their data and office computers, and then to online collaboration tools. People rely on Microsoft Teams as a means to exchange direct messages -more than 700 daily users sent private chat messages over Teams in the last week of March. In total, they exchanged more than 17 000 messages per day. Interestingly, video calls and meetings keep growing as well, topping to 400 users per day, making more than 1 500 calls per day. Team chat messages instead show a drop in popularity after an initial surge. Take away: The lockdown has pushed smart working to widespread adoption.

            "text": "How much massive online teaching costs in terms of network traffic? Clearly, the answer to this question depends on the technical parameters of the online teaching environment. PoliTO's infrastructure includes the deployment of teaching tools for (i) virtual classroom; (ii) on-demand video of pre-recorded classes (stored as 720p video); (iii) other teaching material (e.g., slides, teachers' notes, other useful files). The virtual classroom service allows the students to watch a live video of the lecturer, an optional whiteboard as well as the direct sharing of the lecturer's screen. The BBB platform uses dedicated servers and WebRTC to set up multiple RTP streams that carry the live video and audio. On-demand video and teaching material are instead offered by additional servers as standard HTTP downloads. Figure 6a details the traffic volume for each service during the fourth week of March. The figure reports the average bitrate of the traffic leaving the Campus -i.e., from the servers to the clients, for each hour. During weekdays, the total bitrate exceeds 1 Gbit/s, with live streaming of classes responsible for a bit more than one third of the traffic. During the weekend, when no lecture is scheduled, we still observe large traffic (up to 750 Mbit/s) due to students downloading on-demand lectures and teaching material. Virtual classroom traffic starts and ends within the schedule, while students keep accessing on-demand classroom and material also at night. Figure 6b shows how the accesses to teaching facilities are distributed over the day. We take the start time of each student connection to a teaching server and plot the number of new connections observed every five minutes. Accesses to live classrooms (red solid line) clearly follow the schedule of the campus lectures, which begin every 90 minutes, from 8:30 AM until 7 PM. When lectures begin, thousands of students start a new session with the live classrooms servers, resulting in peaks of more than 4 500 connections. Different is the case for on-demand classrooms and teaching material (blue and green dashed lines, respectively), whose consumption is spread over the day. As said above, students download such material also late in the evenings, including sizeable accesses even after midnight. We complement the above picture with Figure 7 , in which we show different characteristics of the virtual classroom sessions. Using logs exported by Tstat, we analyze the RTP streams that serve multimedia content (audio and video) to the students and report the distribution of the per-flow average bitrate in Figure 7a , separately per audio and video. 10 All classes carry an audio track, with 40 kbit/s average bitrate -the expected VoIP bitrate according to the BBB configuration. Considering video, we observe that lecturers usually select the medium quality at 100 kbit/s, but we observe a considerable amount of streams at 50 kbit/s (low quality) and 200 kbit/s (high quality). Remind that PoliTO setup allows four quality levels, as explained in Section 2.3. In only 10% of the cases, streams reach 300 kbit/s or higher, meaning that ultra-high quality video and screen sharing are seldom used. In all cases, bandwidth is not a major problem for BBB, and students need no more than 0.5-1.0 Mbit/s to enjoy a lecture.",

The violin plots depict the distributions of the minimum RTT which Tstat computes by measuring the time between a data segment and its corresponding acknowledgment. RTT is impacted (i) by the physical distance from clients to servers, (ii) by access technology delays and network congestion, and (iii) Internet routing. Notice how the RTT distribution is very condensed for Fastweb (median at around 20 ms). On the other extreme, wireless-only providers have widespread distributions, with a median over 40 ms, and peaks above 100 ms (see Free Mobile as the clearest example). Figure 8d extends the analysis showing a per-flow comparison of RTT versus throughput for two providers. The low RTT for the (fiber- most) customers on Fastweb comes together with a large throughput. The more variable 3G/4G network on Free Mobile results in higher and more distributed RTT and lower throughput. In extreme cases, very large RTT values together with very low throughput are symptoms of possible network congestion. Take away: Despite the variability of results, the very large majority of Italian ISPs can easily meet the roughly 1 Mbit/s required to enjoy live-streaming classes. Only a few customers, in particular those relying on 3G/4G access technologies, may suffer large delays and limited throughput with potential to disturb the user experience.",

            "text": "We repeat the performance analysis considering the geographical region from where students connect to the online teaching system. Students in some countries 12 are reported to have problems following online lectures due to poor Internet connectivity. Whereas we cannot measure the number of students suffering from a total lack of connectivity, we can estimate whether PoliTO's students and faculty experience different performance when connecting from different regions of Italy. Figure 9 visually reports the number of flows per Italian region. Again, we consider only connections downloading at least 10 MB. We can see that people have connected to the teaching system from all Italian regions. Naturally, a larger number of connections is seen for Piedmont, where PoliTO is located -the region marked in dark-blue in northwestern Italy. Still, significant numbers of students are seen in other regions, allowing us to make fair comparisons. Figure 10 compares performance metrics for connections coming for the several Italian regions. We use violin plots once again, and sort regions in the x \u2212 axes from the best to the worst median value for the metric in each plot. Figure 10a presents the distributions of RTT. Here physical distance is expected to play a key role. Yet, interesting patterns emerge. First, note that connections from Latium (the region where Rome is located) typically experience lower RTT than connections from Piedmont. This is an artifact due to Internet routing: Most Internet providers peer with GARR via Internet exchanges in Rome or Milan. This aspect causes routing detours that artificially increase RTT for all regions, but Latium and in part Lombardy. Second, whereas southern regions are penalized by their distance to PoliTO, much noisier RTT distributions are seen for some northern regions. Observe, for example, that Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, two economically strong regions in northern Italian, have a large portion of connections with larger RTT than the median connection from Sicily (an island in southern Italy). This reflects again the different mix of access technologies and Internet routing of ISPs. Figure 10b depicts distribution of the average connection throughput. We can see a large difference in throughput for the different regions. Connections coming from the best-performing regions have median average throughput twice as high as the regions with the lowest figures. Observe how some regions with large median RTT, such as Sicily and Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, still present good throughput figures. These results suggest that their large RTTs are mostly due to physical and routing distances rather than congestion. In some cases, large RTT variations, such as those observed for Veneto, are coupled with low throughput figures, which result in low Internet quality for a sizeable percentage of customers.",

Recall that many RDP servers were enabled during that week for easing smart working. Yet, this increase is a consequence of the deployment of the new systems and would happen even without the lockdown. As potential attackers have found new RDP servers online, they perform more scanning and brute-force activity against these nodes, too. The posterior decrease in RDP events is explained by changes in the firewall setup, performed to limit such scan activity.",

Microsoft reported a 755% increase in usage of its cloud services [7] , while YouTube and NetFlix reduced the streaming quality in Europe to prevent overload on the network [8] . CloudFlare and Fastly, two of the largest Content Delivery Networks worldwide, report a 20-40% increase in daily traffic since the lockdown in Italy [1, 2] , with somehow reduced performance. Considering ISPs, the surge of network traffic has been testified with public news and blog articles. Vodafone states that fixed broadband usage has increased by more than 50% in Italy and Spain [9] , with a 100% surge in upstream traffic and 44% for downstream. Telefonica IP networks experienced a traffic increase of close to 40% while mobile voice use increased by about 50% and 25% in the case of data [10] . Also European Internet Exchange Points measured an increase of traffic in the order of 10-40% [11, 12] . Outside Europe, Comcast, one of the largest US operators, reports a 32% increase in upstream traffic growth and an 18% increase in downstream traffic growth [13] . In this work, we complement the above reports with additional figures showing the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Campus networks and e-learning facilities.",

Results show that the campus and the Internet have proved robust to successfully cope with challenges and maintain the university operations.",
