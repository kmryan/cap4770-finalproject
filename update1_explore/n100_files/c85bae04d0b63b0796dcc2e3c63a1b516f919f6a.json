Transmission of plant viruses by insects is of particular agricultural importance. Huge areas of monoculture and the inappropriate use of pesticides that kill natural predators can result in massive population booms of pest insects such as aphids. Plant viruses rely on a mechanical breach of the integrity of a cell wall to directly introduce a virus particle into a cell. This is achieved either by the vector associated with transmission of the virus or simply by mechanical damage to cells. Transfer by insect vectors is a particularly efficient means of virus transmission. In some instances, viruses are transmitted mechanically from one plant to the next by the vector and the insect is only a means of distribution, through flying or being carried on the wind for long distances (sometimes hundreds of miles). Insects that bite or suck plant tissues are the ideal means of transmitting viruses to new hosts-a process known as nonpropagative transmission. However, in other cases (e.g., many plant rhabdoviruses), the virus may also infect and multiply in the tissues of the insect (propagative transmission) as well as those of host plants.

However, the problem these viruses face in reinfection and recruitment of new cells is the same as the one they faced initially-how to cross the barrier of the plant cell wall. Plant cell walls necessarily contain channels called \"plasmodesmata\" which allow plant cells to communicate with each other and to pass metabolites between them. However, these channels are too small to allow the passage of virus particles or genomic nucleic acids. Many (if not most) plant viruses have evolved specialized movement proteins that modify the plasmodesmata. One of the best known examples of this is the 30-k protein of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).

IgM is a large, multivalent molecule that is most effective at cross-linking large targets (e.g., bacterial cell walls or flagella) but is probably less important in combating virus infections. In contrast, the production of IgA is very important for initial protection from virus infection. Secretory IgA is produced at mucosal surfaces and results in \"mucosal immunity,\" an important factor in preventing infection from occurring. Induction of mucosal immunity depends to a large extent on the way in which antigens are presented to and recognized by the immune system. Similar antigens incorporated into different vaccine delivery systems (see \"Prevention and Therapy of Virus Infection\") can lead to very different results in this respect, and mucosal immunity is such an important factor that similar vaccines may vary considerably in their efficacy.

A secondary consequence of antibody binding is phagocytosis of antibody-coated (\"opsonized\") target molecules by mononuclear cells or polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This results from the presence of the Fc receptor on the surface of these cells, but as has already been noted in Chapter 4, in some cases opsonization of virus by the binding of nonneutralizing antibodies can result in enhanced virus uptake. This has been shown to occur with rabies virus, and in the case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may promote uptake of the virus by macrophages. Nonphagocytic cells can also destroy antibody-coated viruses via an intracellular pathway involving the TRIM21 protein. Antibody binding also leads to the activation of the complement cascade, which assists in the neutralization of virus particles. Structural alteration of virus particles by complement binding can sometimes be visualized directly by electron microscopy. Complement is particularly important early in virus infection when limited amounts of low-affinity antibody are made-complement enhances the action of these early responses to infection. Despite all the above mechanisms, in overall terms cell-mediated immunity is probably more important than humoral immunity in the control of virus infections. This is demonstrated by the following observations: I Congenital defects in cell-mediated immunity tend to result in predisposition to virus (and parasitic) infections, rather than to bacterial infections.

They are not major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted. In other works, NK cells are able to recognize virus-infected cells without being presented with a specific antigen by a macromolecular complex consisting of MHC antigens plus the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex. The advantage of this is that NK cells have broad specificity (many antigens rather than a single epitope) and are also active without the requirement for sensitizing antibodies. They are therefore the first line of defense against virus infection. NK cells are most active in the early stages of infection (i.e., in the first few days), and their activity is stimulated by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. NK cells are not directly induced by virus infection-they exist even in immunologically naive individuals and are \"revealed\" in the presence of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2.

Their function is complementary to and is later taken over by CTLs which are part of the \"adaptive\" immune response.

(MHC-I antigens are expressed on all nucleated cells in the body; MHC class II antigens are expressed only on the surface of the antigen-presenting cells of the immune system-T-cells, B-cells, and macrophages.) CTL activity requires \"help\" (i.e., cytokine production) from T-helper cells. The CTLs themselves recognize foreign antigens through the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex, which \"docks\" with antigen presented by MHC-I on the surface of the target cell ( Figure 6 .4). The mechanism of cell killing by CTL is similar to that of NK cells (explained below). The induction of a CTL response also results in the release of many different cytokines from T-helper cells, some of which result in clonal proliferation of antigen-specific CTL and others that have direct antiviral effects-for example, IFNs. The kinetics of the CTL response (peaking at about 7 days after infection) is somewhat slower than the NK response (e.g., 3\u00c07 days cf. 0.5\u00c03 days)-so NK cells and CTLs are complementary systems.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 872, "end": 880, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "IMMUNE RESPONSES TO VIRUS INFECTIONS IN ANIMALS"}, {"text": "The induction of a CTL response is dependent on recognition of specific T-cell epitopes by the immune system.

These are important considerations in the design of antiviral vaccines. The specificity of cell killing by CTLs is not absolute. Although they are better \"behaved\" than NK cells, diffusion of perforin and local cytokine production frequently results in inflammation and bystander cell damage. This is a contributory cause of the pathology of many virus diseases (see Chapter 7), but the less attractive alternative is to allow virus replication to proceed unchecked. ADCC is less well understood than either of the two mechanisms mentioned above. ADCC can be carried out by NK cells or by CTLs. The mechanism of cell killing is the same as that described in the next section, although complement may also be involved in ADCC. The distinguishing feature of ADCC is that this mechanism is dependent on the recognition of antigen on the surface of the target cell by means of antibody on the surface of the effector cell. The antibody involved is usually IgG, which is bound to Fc receptors on the surface of the T-cell. ADCC therefore requires a preexisting antibody response and hence does not occur early during primary virus infections-it is part of the adaptive immune response.

The outer layer (epidermis) consists of dead cells and therefore does not support virus replication. Very few viruses infect directly by this route unless there is prior injury such as minor trauma or puncture of the barrier, such as insect or animal bites or subcutaneous injections. Some viruses that do use this route include HSV and papillomaviruses, although these viruses probably still require some form of disruption of the skin such as small abrasions or eczema. I Mucosal membranes: The mucosal membranes of the eye and genitourinary (GU) tract are much more favorable routes of access for viruses to the tissues of the body. This is reflected by the number of viruses that can be sexually transmitted; virus infections of the eye are also quite common (Table 6 .2). I Alimentary canal: Viruses may infect the alimentary canal via the mouth, oropharynx, gut, or rectum, although viruses that infect the gut via the oral route must survive passage through the stomach, an extremely hostile environment with a very low pH and high concentrations of digestive enzymes. Nevertheless, the gut is a highly valued prize for viruses-the intestinal epithelium is constantly replicating and a good deal of lymphoid tissue is associated with the gut which provides many opportunities for virus replication. Moreover, the constant intake of food and fluids provides ample opportunity for viruses to infect these tissues (Table 6 .3). To counteract this problem, the gut has many specific (e.g., secretory antibodies) and nonspecific (e.g., stomach acids and bile salts) defense mechanisms. I Respiratory tract: The respiratory tract is probably the most frequent site of virus infection. As with the gut, it is constantly in contact with external virus particles which are taken in during respiration. As a result, the respiratory tract also has defenses aimed at virus infection-filtering of particulate matter in the sinuses and the presence of cells and antibodies of the immune system in the lower regions. Viruses that infect the respiratory tract usually come directly from the respiratory tract of others, as aerosol spread is very efficient: \"coughs and sneezes spread diseases\" (Table 6 .4).

Most viruses are relatively sensitive to heat, drying, UV light (sunlight), etc., although a few types are quite resistant to these factors. This is particularly important for viruses that are spread via contaminated water or foodstuffsnot only must they be able to survive in the environment until they are ingested by another host, but, as most are spread by the fecal\u00c0oral route, they must also be able to pass through the stomach to infect the gut before being shed in the feces.
