            "text": "BST2/tetherin, an interferon-inducible antiviral factor, can block the cellular release of various enveloped viruses. We previously reported that human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) infection can alleviate the BST2 tethering of HIV-1 virions by downregulating cell surface BST2, suggesting that coronaviruses are capable of encoding anti-BST2 factors. Here we report our new finding that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein, similar to Vpu, is capable of antagonizing the BST2 tethering of SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HIV-1 virus-like particles via BST2 downregulation. However, unlike Vpu (which downmodulates BST2 by means of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways), BST2 downregulation is apparently mediated by SARS-CoV S through the lysosomal degradation pathway only. We found that SARS-CoV S colocalized with both BST2 and reduced cell surface BST2, suggesting an association between SARS-CoV S and BST2 that targets the lysosomal degradation pathway. According to one recent report, SARS-CoV ORF7a antagonizes BST2 by interfering with BST2 glycosylation 1 . Our data provide support for the proposal that SARS-CoV and other enveloped viruses are capable of evolving supplementary anti-BST2 factors in a manner that requires virus replication. Further experiments are required to determine whether the BST2-mediated restriction of authentic SARS-CoV virions is alleviated by the SARS-CoV spike protein.

            "text": "Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2, also designated as CD317 or tetherin) is a type II integral membrane protein containing a cytoplasmic N-terminal region followed by a spanning transmembrane domain and a carboxy-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. 1 BST2 is an interferon-inducible gene that functions as an innate defense system against virus infections. It has been described as a host restriction factor capable of impeding the release of several types of enveloped viruses, including retroviruses, 2-7 filoviruses, [8] [9] [10] arenaviruses, 11 influenza, 12 and the Sendai virus. 13 One research team has proposed that BST2 inhibits virus release by tethering nascent virions to cell surfaces via the N-terminal transmembrane domain and C-terminal GPI anchor. 14 Most BST2-restricted enveloped viruses bud directly from cell surfaces, but a small number of enveloped viruses (eg, herpesviruses) are subject to BST2-related restrictions even though their final envelopment entails membranes from TGN and/or endosomal compartments and egression via exocytosis. 15, 16 In a previous study we reported that the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), whose assembly and budding occurs at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and whose virions are released via vesicle exocytosis, [17] [18] [19] is also subject to BST2 inhibition. Results from electron microscopy analyses indicate the presence of HCoV-229E virions on cell surfaces or on the membranes of intracellular vesicles that tend to cluster with BST2. This suggests the BST2-triggered tethering of budding virions to vesicle membranes that remain on cell surfaces at the plasma membrane after exocytosis. 17 BST2 has been described as moderately restricting the release of the hepatitis C virus, whose assembly takes place in the ER and whose release from cells via secretory pathways occurs in a manner similar to that of coronaviruses. 20, 21 Combined, these data support the assumption that enveloped virus budding and release occurring at the plasma membrane or in an intracellular compartment is subject to BST2 blocking. BST2 is a component of innate immune response in the form of restricted enveloped virion release, and many viruses have evolved specific antagonists to counteract BST2 antiviral activity: HIV-1 Vpu, HIV-2 Env, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Nef and Env, Ebola and Sendai virus GP, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus K5, and influenza virus neuraminidase are all capable of antagonizing BST2. [2] [3] [4] [5] 9, 12, 13, 15, 22 Since some of these anti-BST2 viral factors are viral envelope glycoproteins, there is speculation that SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein may possess the property to counteract the BST2 blocking of virus release. Our work is built in part on an earlier finding by another research team that the ORF7a accessory protein (encoded by SARS-CoV) inhibits the BST2 tethering of virions. 23 We also found that the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is capable of downmodulating BST2, thus mitigating the BST2-mediated restriction of virus-like particle (VLP) release, and suggesting that SARS-CoV and other enveloped viruses are capable of evolving additional anti-BST2 factors.",

Transfectants were treated with either MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor) 39 or ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl, a lysosome inhibitor). 40 We found that BST2 downregulation mediated by SARS-CoV S was not significantly affected when the proteasome function was inhibited, but was noticeably reduced following lysosome function inhibition ( Figure 5, lanes 5-7) . Consistent with previous reports, we observed that proteasome or lysosome function inhibition resulted in markedly reduced Vpu-mediated BST2 downregulation ( Figure 5, lanes 2-4) , suggesting that BST2 downregulation as mediated by SARS-CoV S largely occurs via the lysosomal degradation pathway. Since BST2 largely localizes at cell surfaces (where they tether virions to prevent their release), we tested whether SARS-CoV S antagonizes BST2 via surface BST2 downregulation. 293 cells were cotransfected with BST2 and SARS-CoV S expression vectors. We observed that BST2 and S colocalized in perinuclear areas, but BST2 signals were barely detectable on cell surfaces. Instead, BST2 largely localized in perinuclear areas regardless of whether or not it was coexpressed with S ( Figure 6A ). This is consistent with a previous report that unlike HeLa-endogenous BST2 (which localizes on cell surfaces as well as in the perinuclear area), exogenous BST2 predominantly localizes in perinuclear areas, with little distribution on cell surfaces. 41 Nevertheless, flow cytometry quantification suggests that BST2 cell surface expression is noticeably reduced in 293T cells following SARS-CoV S coexpression ( Figure 6C ). In the case of HeLa cells (which constitutively express BST2), we did found SARS-CoV S colocalized with BST2 in the plasma membrane ( Figure 6B ). BST2 green fluorescence intensity on HeLa cell surfaces decreased slightly following SARS-CoV S coexpression, suggesting that the capacity of SARS-CoV S to counteract the BST2-associated inhibition of virion release was due in part to cell surface BST2 downmodulation.",

Since the BST2 inhibition of HIV-1 release via virion tethering at cell surfaces is well documented, we used a Vpudeficient HIV-1 virus-producing vector (NL4.3delVpu) as a control in our experiments. As shown in Figure 2 , coronavirus VLPs (similar to those of HIV-1) were tethered to cell surfaces by BST2, and BST2 inhibited SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E VLP release in a BST2 dimerization-dependent manner, similar to HIV-1 ( Figure 3 ). Further, in the same manner, as Vpu, SARS-CoV S facilitated HIV-1 release via BST2 downregulation (Figure 4) . We determined that Vpu downmodulated BST2 via proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways and that the predominant lysosomal pathway was mediated by SARS-CoV S ( Figure 5 ). Our confocal microscopy observations suggest that SARS-CoV S colocalized with BST2 at HeLa cell surfaces ( Figure 6 ). SARS-CoV S likely binds to BST2, after which it serves as a target for lysosomal degradation. Vpu is capable of trapping BST2 intracellularly and preventing its recycling back into the plasma membrane. 29, 35, 37, 42, 43 Whether SARS-CoV S similarly counteracts BST2 requires further investigation.",

This suggests that VLP release is also subject to restrictions associated with endogenous BST2. To determine whether reduced VLP yield is a result of VLPs being tethered to cell membranes by BST2, cells were treated with subtilisin, a nonspecific protease capable of triggering cell surface-associated virion release via BST2 cleavage. 17,33 Our results indicate increased medium-associated VLP quantities following subtilisin treatment (Figures 2A-C, lane 6 vs. lane 4), confirming that BST2 trapped VLPs on cell surfaces.
