In the EU without borders such transports only require mandatory health certificates, signed by an official veterinarian, and proper vaccinations (e.g. rabies). Rabies, Echinoccocus granulosus and Leishmania are in many countries therefore 'imported' infections. Import of canine babesiosis (not a zoonosis) and probable settlement in Western Europe including its vector ( Dermacentor reticulatus) are a clear sign of dragging off zoonoses (Daugschier 2001) . Harmonization of parasite control in Europe has taken place by the independent organization ESCCAP (www. esccap.org) in order to enable veterinarians to inform clients about the differences of endemic diseases in the various European countries and how to prevent contracting or importing infectious diseases when traveling with dogs (holidays, animal assisted-dogs) or purchasing dogs from abroad. Obviously, this is not only of value regarding parasitic infections, but also for bacterial or viral zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis, rabies), however, comparable informative websites for veterinarians do not exist yet. Transports from dogs originating from Eastern Europe (Romania, Bulgaria) and Mediterranean countries (Spain, Italy) for commercial enterprise to the Northwest of Europe increase the spreading of unwanted and unexpected zoonoses to non-endemic areas such as cystic echinococcosis (Carnena and Cardona 2013).
