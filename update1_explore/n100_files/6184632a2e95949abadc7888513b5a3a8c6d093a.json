The previous requirement of virtual visits requiring registration of the physician and the patient with a training module was relaxed to allow simple phone calls when possible. These visits could be logged into Epic as an encounter and documented with timebased coding consistent with the updated Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) telehealth guidelines. 5 Selected patients, including postoperative patients requiring wound checks and suture removal, continue to be seen in-person. For those patients, care is ensured that physical distancing is observed in the waiting area, waiting times are minimized, and the number of healthcare providers reduced to essential personnel. All in person activities have been consolidated to 1 outpatient area. As such, a rotating schedule of an on-site PSC exists, with all other PSCs working from home remotely. The on-site PSC provides check in service for all providers-for telemedicine or in-person visits. After the provider finishes the visits they communicate with their off-site PSC to arrange follow-up visit, imaging, or surgery scheduling. Urgent surgical procedures are screened by the department for referral to the OR scheduling group. This approach has minimized the overall foot traffic in the clinic area to essential staff and patients. The volume reductions and the transition to a shared model (vs individual practice support) results in a 'skeleton crews' onsite and offsite. Staff outside of these crews can then be made available to the enterprise by contributing to shared labor pools that match hospital needs with staff expertise and skills. Approximately 50% of our office staff was listed as 'redeployable' to other clinical areas.",

Based on this, as well as growing evidence of the existence of asymptomatic carriers, 7,8 that asymptomatic patient can have viral loads similar to symptomatic patients and higher viral loads being reported in the nasal cavity compared to the pharynx 9 additional guidelines were developed for operations considered to be at additional high risk.

For example, the aforementioned measures resulted in a 44% reduction in charges when compared to average baseline for 1 of the 2 physician organizations during the first week of implementation. This is expected to be reduced even more in the coming weeks of the pandemic. The loss of elective surgeries will disproportionally affect specialties whose compensation derives by work relative value units or profits/loss statements more so than straight salaries, at least initially. Already, at several AMCs in the Boston area there have been reports of halting pension contributions, bonus pay, and or planned increases in compensation. 10 The elimination of elective surgeries, one of the most profitable sources of technical revenue, for AMCs and downstream revenue from radiological and pathological analyses will also result in a severe financial stress. The current emergency package approved by the US Congress in March 2020 that will provide between $100 and 150 billion dollars for hospitals and healthcare, while helpful, is unlikely to be sufficient to restore financial health to many institutions. Like the financial crisis of 2008 led to the financial failure of many businesses with a weak balance sheet, the current crisis is likely to lead to the financial failure of many hospitals and AMCs, requiring more mergers or acquisitions with entities that can withstand the current financial stress, more bailouts from state governments or closures.",

The patient was subsequently admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit only to develop hypoxemic respiratory failure 3 d later and was subsequently found to have a positive COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Contact tracing revealed that over 100 healthcare providers had been exposed to the patient between the 2 healthcare facilities prior to the positive result, including the neurosurgery attending of record and 6 neurosurgery residents (28% of the total trainee workforce). Based on the CDC and institutional guidelines, exposed asymptomatic healthcare workers were able to resume duties and self-monitor for symptoms; fortunately, none of our staff developed symptoms as a result of this exposure. This early experience highlighted the impact that a single exposure can have on a department as well as an institution as a whole and was instrumental in the rapid implementation of the adaptations highlighted in this paper. This impact can have significant consequences on departments such as neurosurgery which have a small overall workforce that is difficult to reinforce externally. This has led to a series of decisions on how best to limit exposure, establish a \"bench\" team, and develop collaboration with partnering institutions to support each other with shared guidelines and staff support in a worst-case scenario.
