Moreover, for ethical reasons, data access is often granted only to particular subsets, restricting analyses to cover single days, weeks, or geographical areas. Consequently, it is frequently impossible to set a particular analysis or event in its context and know how typical it is, compared to other days, weeks or months. This is important for academic referees questioning research on mobile phone data and for the analysts in deciding how to sample, how much data to process, and which events are anomalous. All these issues require an understanding of variability in Big Data to answer the question of how average is average? This paper provides a method, using a large mobile phone dataset, to answer these basic but necessary questions. We show that file size is a robust proxy for the activity level of phone users by profiling the temporal variability of the data at an hourly, daily and monthly level. We then apply time-series analysis to isolate temporal periodicity. Finally, we discuss confidence limits to anomalous events in the data. We recommend an analytical approach to mobile phone data selection which suggests that ideally data should be sampled across days, across working weeks, and across the year, to obtain a representative average. However, where this is impossible, the temporal variability is such that specific weekdays' data can provide a fair picture of other days in their general structure.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Often mobile phone research requires selecting a sample of records because of computational or ethical restrictions and this raises questions of representativeness. Here we develop a methodology to make an informed sample choice by understanding the temporal variability inherent in the data. In COVID-19 research, for instance to measure how much human activity has changed, a comparative 'normal' baseline is necessary. But which days and hours are most 'normal' for this baseline? By analysing phone activity over a duration of more than 500 days using simple statistical procedures, we demonstrate a method to get the most stable findings by selecting 11.00 on Thursdays as the less variable day/hour -a day and hour with least variability than other weekdays.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "As the sun rises on any given day, people go to work or education, engage in other daily activities whilst yet others stay at home, collectively making up the vibrant buzz and spatial patterns of the society. Modelling this complex behaviour demands large amounts of data, feasible due to recent advances in data collection and processing. The advent of Big Data, whether from mobile phones (1), travel cards (2) , or social media (3) , enables mapping of the daily patterns to understand such phenomena as segregation (4) (5), spread of diseases such as Covid-19 (6) (7), human mobility (8) (9) , and urban dynamics (10) . The time-dimensional difference between traditional data-sources in the form of census data or population registers means that what was measured on decennial or annual periodicity now can be measured in real time. As a result, there is an increasing number of studies using finer temporal resolutions in societal studies but there are, to our knowledge, no studies indicating which days or hours that are representative for societal activities in general. There is also a growing interest in the ethical implications of the collection and use of Big Data and much discussion about how to visualise and analyse these large datasets (11) (12) . We address these concerns by asking 'how normal is normal?'. Understanding the periodicity and typical patterns in the data is important since one response to ethical/privacy concerns is to allow analysis only of a subset of the data and one quick answer to the large size of Big Data is similarly to subsample the data whether for a day, a week, a month or a particular place. These seemingly trivial questions are vital to our understanding of complexity and variability in Big Data and answering whether it is sufficient to analyse data for a day or a week to improve our understanding of societal processes such as segregation, whether all data should be analysed, or when and if there are decreasing returns to computing time in revealing the difference. Furthermore, to assess the impact of shock events such as extreme weather to get a better grasp on social resilience, it is important to study the natural dataset variability at different temporal scales and periodicities. After all, to understand how anomalous an event is, it is necessary to have a benchmark against which to judge it.

Variation in the number of users and in daily travel distances manifested weekly, monthly and seasonal regularities in population movement around the holidays in connection with the earthquake in Haiti, the analysis (14) requiring opening and processing the trajectories of individuals. Comparison (15) of the load volume on electrical infrastructure with phone activity in Senegal, so that phone activity can function as a proxy for level of development/electrification, also required processing of the files. A visual analytic approach to detecting anomalies in call activity in Senegal (16) entailed illustrating visually the temporal changes in weekends/religious holidays. These studies showed significant and detectable variability in mobile phone activity based on Call Detail Records (CDR). Our Network Detail Records (NDR) dataset comprises calls, SMS, MMS, data connections, and also silent handovers, thus having more frequent entries per user than the popularly used CDR. Given the structure of our dataset, the activity level is proportional to the number of observations/rows in the dataset and thus to the file size (see supplementary Figure S2 ). We propose a convenient estimate of variability in activity based on file sizes, without opening them, with a measurement of deviation between expected vs observed periodical temporal signature of mobile phone activity.

Table 1 shows the results of the empty model with no fixed effects and with standardised file size as the dependent variable. It shows that most of the variation is between hours (83.9%), followed by months (7.9%) and days (4.3%). An additional 3.9% of the variance cannot be explained but might be related other external factors such as weather and national events. Table 2 presents the results of the full MLM with fixed effects. The random effects parameters indicate that the hour-level variation drops to 81.1% while no change is detectable at day and month-year (MY) levels. The fixed effects explain around 2.3% (note that cumulative % is reaching 97.7%) of the variation. This may sound small, but is in line with the expectations since the majority of phone usage is connected to regular reoccurring events such as workdays and weekends, night-rest and active hours. Of the fixed effects it is clear that religious and secular holidays significantly and negatively reduce the file size (usage of phones) while major sports and TV media-events increased the file sizes. Hours with major transport breakdowns or out-of-the-ordinary weather have small effects although some are statistically significant. In Table 3 , the third restricted model, an alternative empty model, is specified, which excludes festivals and national events leaving only 'normal' days. The results indicate that taking away unusual days strengthens the already clear temporality observed in the data; the variation attributable to hours increases to 84.2%, months to 8.0%, although that for days remains the same. In the final analytical stage, the difference between observed file sizes and the values predicted by all three of the multilevel models for hours and days is analysed using RMSD. This shows which hours and which days are easier to predict. As a baseline, the three models produce RMSD values of ~0,1877 for the empty model, ~0,1834 for the full model and ~0,1737 for the restricted empty model. The variation is largest for the empty model, with slight reduction when introducing fixed effects (full model) and smallest when all days having events are removed from the analysis (restricted model).

The method demonstrated to estimate the activity of mobile phone users from file size offers a quick and convenient way to extract patterns from datasets that are otherwise unwieldy thereby enabling generalisations to be made to set samples in their context. Our model (see Figure S3 ) closely predicts observed file sizes (and thus levels of activity and phone usage).

This also explains the volatility of the hours between 05:00 and 07:00 and 22:00 and 00:00 where behaviour will vary for the same reasons -other times of the day are less variable. The hourly variability therefore means most care should be taken in selecting which hours to sample; this is the largest source of variation in our data.
