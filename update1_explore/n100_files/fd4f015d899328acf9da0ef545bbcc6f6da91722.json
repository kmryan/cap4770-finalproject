As proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role in the development and maintenance of local inflammation, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of OMZ on immune cells in order to diminish the mucosal infiltration of the nose. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from buffy coats of healthy volunteers were isolated and stimulated in the presence or absence of OMZ. In addition, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) were generated and different concentrations of OMZ were added. DC phenotype and their T-cell stimulatory properties were analysed.The vasoactive substance OMZ showed a concentration dependent inhibitory effect on T-cell activation as well as a dominant effect on T-cell stimulatory properties of DC. Low concentrations of OMZ inhibited the proliferation of polyclonally activated T cells.",

Interestingly, the addition of IL-6 to DC-T-cell coculture was able to completely restore T-cell proliferation.In conclusion, these findings indicate that the anti-inflammatory properties of OMZ are partially mediated by the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines as well as reduced T-cell stimulatory capacity of DC resulting in a repressed stimulation of T cells. Therefore, the therapeutic benefit of OMZ can be explained in part by its immunomodulating effects in the topical treatment of nasal inflammation.",

            "text": "The nasal mucosa is the most commonly infected tissue in the body. Most adults are afflicted by two to four symptomatic upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) every year. In children, these symptomatic infections are even more frequent. About 80% of acute rhinitis infections are caused by viruses, the majority being rhinoviruses (1) . Other species frequently causing cold symptoms are coronaviruses, (para)influenza viruses, respirators syncytial virus and adenoviruses (2, 3) . Despite its frequent occurrence, little is known about the pathogenesis of URTIs. It is currently believed that the symptoms of an URTI are the result of the host's inflammatory immune response to the virus rather than a direct viral cytotoxic effect (4, 5) . This concept is supported by various observations in vitro and in vivo demonstrating that nasal secretions during rhinovirus infection become enriched in albumin, kinins, immunoglobulin-G (IgG) and proinflammatory cytokines. This is usually accompanied by a predominantly neutrophilic cellular infiltrate (4) (5) (6) . The virus-induced strong inflammatory response is mediated by specific proinflammatory cytokines released by, e.g. respiratory syncytial virus-infected human pulmonary epithelial cells (7) . Subsequently, proinflammatory cytokines activate various cell populations and strongly induce adhesion molecule expression which facilitates transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells. As regulators of chemotaxis, proliferation and the activity of inflammatory cells, these mediators play a central role in the pathogenesis of URTIs. This assumption has been supported by a clinical study (8) showing that proinflammatory mediators including bradykinin, interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and myeloperoxidase rose significantly with the onset of rhinitis symptoms and reached a plateau level over the ensuing symptomatic days. Based on such findings, it is reasonable to assume that epithelial cell-derived proinflammatory cytokines initiate an adhesion cascade and then activate the recruited inflammatory cells. These activated cells again secrete large amounts of cytokines, resulting in an amplification of the inflammatory process.",

They are located in an immature form in nonlymphoid tissues and are specialized to capture and process antigen. However, release of inflammatory factors during local infections leads to a functional maturation of DC resulting in an increased migratory and T-cell stimulatory capacity (11, 12) . Mature DC actively migrate into the regional lymph nodes where they prime and boost antigen-specific T cells (13, 14) . Therefore, DC play a major role in the process of inflammation. In addition, DC activated through bacterial or viral components release large amounts of factors that again boost the inflammation (15) . Considering these facts, our attempt was to investigate whether oxymetazoline hydrochloride (OMZ) influences the inflammatory potential of human immune cells, as both DC and T cells are known to express alpha-adrenergic receptors on the cell surface (16, 17) , and to determine its possible anti-inflammatory/ immunomodulating activities. OMZ is a sympathomimetic imidazoline derivative commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of acute (viral) rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, sinusitis and syringitis. Topical application to the nasal mucosa results in a vasoconstriction lasting up to 12 h causing decongestion, reduced rhinitis symptoms and a shortage of the duration of the cold (18) .",

To investigate the immunomodulatory effects described above in more detail, we analysed the influence of OMZ on DC maturation. Therefore, different concentrations of OMZ were added to cultures of monocyte-derived DC during terminal maturation. As presented in Fig. 4 , OMZ in nontoxic doses (0.001%) did not show any influence on the well-known upregulation of costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 or the differentiation marker CD83 (11) when compared with untreated DC, showing that the phenotype of mature DC is not altered in general by the presence of OMZ during terminal differentiation. However, DC matured in the presence of OMZ showed a remarkably reduced T-cell stimulatory capacity detectable in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) (Fig. 5a) when compared with untreated DC. Even addition of 0.00005% OMZ to maturing DC suppressed the T-cell stimulatory properties of DC significantly. To rule out that the observed inhibition of T-cell proliferation resulted from contamin-ating OMZ in the MLR, transwell experiments were performed. After physical separation in transwell chambers (Fig. 5b) , OMZ-treated DC could not suppress the proliferation of alloreactive T cells stimulated by untreated DC showing that the observed effect was not mediated by an OMZ contamination or other soluble factors induced by OMZ. However, direct addition of OMZ-treated DC to the cultures markedly inhibited the MLR in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5c) showing again that OMZ suppresses the stimulatory properties of DC significantly. In a next step, the cytokine production of DC matured in the presence of non-toxic concentrations of OMZ was analysed. Therefore, DC were generated as described above. On day 7 (1 day after the addition of the maturation cocktail), cells were washed intensively and recultured in medium alone without any cytokines. The supernatants were collected after 24 h and proinflammatory cytokines were detected by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 6a , production of IL-8 was significantly reduced in the presence of OMZ (0.001%) compared with the IL-8 production of untreated DC. In addition, the synthesis of TNF-a and IL-6 by DC was inhibited in the presence of OMZ. In contrast, production of IL-1b,IL-12 and PGE 2 was not altered (data not shown). In order to analyse whether the suppressed cytokine production of OMZ-treated DC is relevant for their reduced immunostimulatory capacity we added the above-mentioned cytokines to DC-T-cell co-cultures. Whereas the addition of TNF-a and IL-8 did not show any effect (data not shown), addition of IL-6 completely restored T-cell proliferation (Fig. 6b) .",

These proinflammatory cytokines are secreted at least in part by the respiratory epithelial cells and are known to induce and enhance the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells. Adhesion molecules induce the recruitment and transendothelial migration of granulocytes and lymphocytes to the site of inflammation by interacting with their cognate receptors (7, 24) . Proinflammatory cytokines released during viral infections also stimulate the migration of monocytes to the site of infection and their subsequent activation and proliferation. Upon activation, monocytes secrete cytokines such as IL-1b and TNF-a that have antiviral and proinflammatory effects. Especially, IL-1b was found to cause a marked upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 (12, 25) . Thus, monocytes may also sustain and amplify the host inflammatory response, leading to increased cold symptoms. These data demonstrate the importance of proinflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of a naturally acquired URTI and in the amplification of the inflammatory response induced by viral infection.",

Whether cytokine levels (e.g. TNF-a or IL-6) in the nasal fluid of OMZ-treated rhinitis patients are reduced in comparison with untreated patients and thus our findings are of biological relevance is to be clarified in future clinical studies. It will be of great interest to profile induced changes in the (sub)cutaneous cytokine environment to analyse OMZ effects in vivo (25) . Nevertheless, one study already demonstrated that the total protein content of the nasal fluid of OMZ-treated rhinitis patients was significantly reduced (26) .",

            "text": "Oxymetazoline is a sympathomimetic imidazoline derivative commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of acute (viral) rhinitis. Its alpha-adrenergic activity results in a vasoconstriction lasting up to 12 h, if applied topically to the nasal mucosa, causing decongestion. As nasal decongestants including OMZ effectively reduce rhinitis symptoms, a few studies already dealt with their possible anti-inflammatory/immunomodulating activities besides their vasoconstrictive function. The influence of OMZ on pro-, anti-inflammatory and oxidative stress responses through modulation of mediators of the arachidonic acid system such as lipooxygenase and leukotriene could be demonstrated in cell-free systems as well as in the canine macrophage system (27) . In addition, it has been demonstrated that OMZ inhibits human neutrophil functions including actin polymerization, phagocytosis and oxidative burst (28) . In contrast to our study, these inhibitory effects were most pronounced for benzalkonium chloride, which is frequently used as a nose drop preservative. However, benzalkonium can be excluded as a reason for our results as the OMZ solution used in this study did not contain any preservative. The concrete mechanism of action of OMZ still is to be analysed in detail. It is known that OMZ acts via stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors as mentioned above. Most immune cells, including DC and T cells, express these receptors on their cell surface (16, 17) allowing a direct effect of OMZ on these cells. In prior studies it was shown that in mice, modulation of immune cells through alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation was not mediated through inhibition of NFjB but through the MAP38K pathway (29, 30) . Whether this holds true for the human system is to be examined. An interesting aspect is the effect of OMZ on the T-cell stimulatory capacity of human DC. As many studies in the last decade showed that in vitro generated immature and mature DC show phenotypic and functional properties that are comparable to DC in vivo (9-11), our results allow to draw conclusions on the in vivo situation. We show that OMZ is able to inhibit the immunostimulatory capacity of human DC without influencing their phenotype in general. Particularly, upregulation of surface expression of CD80, CD86 and the induced maturation marker CD83 was not affected. Nevertheless, the stimulatory capacity of DC was clearly inhibited by OMZ, most likely through the blockade of cytokine production. Herein, the markedly reduced secretion of IL-6 seems to play an important role for the reduced T-cell stimulatory capacity of OMZ-treated DC as the addition of this cytokine to the DC-T-cell coculture was able to restore T-cell proliferation completely. In contrast to other groups (27, 29) , PGE 2 and IL-12 production was not altered in OMZ-DC compared with untreated DC. Nevertheless, these groups worked with macrophages in the mouse (29) or canine (27) system and thus are difficult to compare to our system working with human DC. Whether the reduced secretion of IL-8, well known to be a potent chemotactic cytokine necessary for the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells (5), plays an important role as well needs to be examined in further studies. As DC are antigen-presenting cells capable of inducing and activating T-cell responses in the local draining lymph nodes, the functional inhibition of DC through OMZ at the site of inflammation may result in a reduced recruitment of immune cells from the local lymph nodes into the skin and mucosa contributing in part to the effect of decongestion seen after application of OMZ in vivo.",
